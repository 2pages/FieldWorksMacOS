		/// in the direction that is to the left for text in the main paragraph direction.
		/// So, in a normal LTR paragraph, left arrow decrements the IP position; in an RTL
		/// paragraph, it increments it. Both produce a movement to the left in text whose
		/// direction matches the paragraph ("downstream" text). But where there is a segment
		/// of upstream text, logical behavior will jump almost to the other end of the
		/// segment and then move the 'wrong' way through it.
