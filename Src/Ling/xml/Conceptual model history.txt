<January 19, 2001> Larry Hayashi and Ken Zook
MoForm: has the Form attribute removed from subclasses and re-added on this superclass.

MoItem has been deleted.
MoStemAllomorph has been added (re-added actually from previous model).
	Left and Right phoneEnviron changed to PhoneEnviron (which was changed from atomic to collection).

MoAffixItem has been deleted.
MoStemItem has been deleted.

MoAffixForm has been re-added.

MoAffixAllomorph has been re-added.
	Left and Right phoneEnviron changed to PhoneEnviron (which was changed from atomic to collection).
	Position attribute added to class.

MoAffixProcess is added and remains the same.

***************************************8
The following additions/changes were made to the M3 documentation and XML class definitions:

MoMorphologicalData: added AnalyzingAgents attribute: owns col of LgAnalyzingAgent.
	added TestSets attribute: owns col of WfiWordSets
Class WfiWordSet added.

WfiAnalysis
	Added attributes: Validating Sources, Invalidating Sources

MoDerivationalAffixMsi:
	Added attribute Defined: boolean

******************************************************************8
New changes to the LanguageProject:
LanguageProject: added AnalyzingAgents attribute: owns col of CmAnalyzingAgent. (Cm because of code generator Load order).

Added new class: CmAnalyzingAgent



**************************************
New changes to lexical database:
Diagrams are in Doc\ImpDiagrams. XML files have been done but not checked in.

Delete LexEntryOrSense abstract superclass.
Add LexCrossRefEntryOrSense to replace above.
Different attributes for LexEntry and LexSense. Only one of these can be used per CrossRefEntryOrSense (or alternatively, if the LexSense is filled in, it wins. IOW LexSense is optional).

LexEntry: Allomorphs now owns MoForms instead of MoItem.
Delete subclass Subentry and move attributes onto MajorEntry.

Delete subclasses InflectedVariant and PhonologicalVariant and move attributes onto Minor Entry.
I think we can actually get rid of phonologicalVariant anyhow because we deal with these in Allomorphs (and their conditions or PhoneEnvironments). Most minor entries will be InflectedVariants. We also have the attribute "OrthographicVariants" on LexEntry to handle what Minor entries in LinguaLinks were handled with. I have a question in this regard. If orthographic variants are to be used in the spelling check system, it would appear that there needs to be an object of:
OrthographicVariant with attributes of Form: MoForm (owned). The condition could actually be captured as the name of the encoding used to capture the MoForm or we could have another attribute of condition (mstr) for spelling differences like colour (British standard spelling) and color (American revolutionist spelling).


******************************************
Added the following to CellarServer diagram:
UserView classes
CmOverlay classes.

*****************************************
Notes to self:
Well, I think I now remember the reason for MoItem as I work to delete it.
MoAffixProcesses are rare. The parser, 80% or more of the time will be working with Allomorphs - be it stem or affix allomorphs. We thought it would be easier to create an index of allomorphs so we created MoItem to capture StemAllomorphs(Items) and AffixAllomorphs(Items). I think we can easily create such an index in the original model with a union table of MoStemAllomorphs and MiAffixAllomorphs. There is no class to define this collection but I'll note it in the model.
