	/// <summary>
	/// ITool implementation for the "AdhocCoprohibitionRuleEdit" tool in the "grammar" area.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// This is the comment from the data model file about an "AdhocCoprohibition" (actual class "MoAdhocProhib":
	///
	/// This abstract class is intended to capture co-occurrence restrictions between morphemes or allomorphs which cannot be captured
	/// using morphosyntactic or phonological restrictions. Linguistically speaking, this is perhaps as bad a kludge as you can imagine.
	/// We allow it here for reasons of stealth-to-wealth work, with the understanding that the program will twist the user's arm into
	/// getting rid of these later on (perhaps by flagging each of these constraints with a Warning). The technique is borrowed from
	/// AMPLE's ad hoc pairs. Note however that, Aronoff (1976: 53) gives as an example of a negative constraint the fact that the
	/// suffix -ness does not attach to adjectives of the form X-ate, X-ant, or X-ent. So maybe this isn't such a kludge after all.
	/// On the other hand, Aronoff's examples are largely statistical generalizations, that is, tendencies - as opposed to hard constraints.
	///
	/// It may be that we should also have positive cooccurrence constraints. Aronoff (1976: 63) lists a number of "forms of the base"
	/// which are compatible with the English prefix un-, among them X-en (where -en is the past participle suffix), X-ing, and X-able,
	/// which would be examples of positive constraints. However, un- also attaches to a good many monomorphemic stems (roots, e.g. unhappy),
	/// so it may be that this is not a real generalization.
	///
	/// In addition to the attributes below, there should probably be an attribute to point to analyses which are ruled out by these constraints.
	/// These could be either grammatical words for which the parser would generate an incorrect analysis if it were not for this constraint,
	/// or ungrammatical words which the user has supplied, and which would be parsed if not for this constraint. It may even be desirable to
	/// allow individual constraints to be turned off in the parsing of such examples, in order to verify that the constraint works, and that
	/// it is (still) needed. However, the need for such an attr is probably more general than this class; see my email of 18 Jan 2000.
