<!-- this file this special instructions for XDE nodes. Currently, all that you are allowed to say is
that a node is not visible. You do that by listing the node here. the id of the node must match the XDE
node that would otherwise produce a slice which you want to hide. note that most XDE nodes
do not otherwise have an ID; you usually have to add 1 before you can reference it in this kind of document.-->
