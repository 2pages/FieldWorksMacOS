// <remarks>
//	At the moment (July 2004), the only instances of this class do filtering in memory.
//	This does not imply that all filtering will always be done in memory, only that we haven't
//	yet designed or implemented a way to do the filtering while querying.
//		when we do, we will probably split RecordFilter into two subclasses, one for in memory
//	filters which can use LCM properties, and one which will somehow contribute to the Where
//	clause which populates the RecordList. In that case, the RecordList will be aware of the filter
//	and will be responsible for somehow incorporating its filtering desires as it does the query.
//
// (JohnT, May 2004). Added additional classes and interfaces designed to support a filter bar
// in a Browse view. (Should these be spread across more files?)
//
// The filter bar looks like a set of combos, one per column, which the user can fill in to limit
// the items shown in the view to ones that satisfy some condition.
//
// The idea here is that, given the XML that defines a cell view, if it is one of the types we
// recognize, we instantiate a corresponding implementation of the StringFinder interface, which
// allows us to obtain the strings shown in the cell given the base object.
//
// Then, given the full object list, we populate a combo box menu with 'blanks', 'non-blanks',
// and a list of the unique values that occur (found by applying the string finder to the objects;
// if more than about 30 are found, give up). Menu could also contain 'use patterns' (then the user
// may type a regexp); a submenu of pattern functions; 'Any of...' (brings up a dialog with the
// complete list of values that occur, and check boxes); 'Any except...' (similar); and perhaps
// eventually something like what the 'Custom...' item brings up in Excel autofilters. The user can
// also just type a string; without pattern matching, only initial and final # (start and end of string)
// have special meaning.
//
// When the user selects a filter option for a cell, we instantiate the appropriate kind of Matcher,
// and combine this with the string finder to make a FilterBarCellFilter. If more than one cell
// is set, or there was an original filter defining the list, we further combine all the filters
// using an AndFilter.
