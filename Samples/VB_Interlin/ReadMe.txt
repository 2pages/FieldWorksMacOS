ReadMe file for the VB_Interlin sample program.

This is a Visual Basic 6 program to demonstrate hosting the view ActiveX control,
and also one kind of interaction with it, overlaying annotations with a combo box
allowing alternative annotations to be selected.

When run, it should display a small window containing a few words of interlinear
text. Clicking on one of the annotations should display a combo box allowing
an annotation to be chosen. I believe it is also possible to edit the baseline,
though nothing smart happens (e.g, creating a new annotation field if you type
a space).

The "choose" button doesn't do anything yet. I was planning to hook up a format
font dialog, I think, but haven't had time.
