Bob Eaton sent me, BobbyD, several files and the following note
on 20-Sep-2003 via email. I have checked in the sample files he sent
me.

The TestEC is a C++ (unmanaged) example, the ECFileConverter is a very
trivial 'open a file, read it in converting it as you go, and write it
out' program, and the MTestEC is the .net client test program which
includes the class1.cs.
