Hello World SideBar sample:

This sample demonstrates the use of the SideBar. There are three tabs added in Visual Designer.

The first tab contains three buttons, added at design time. On this tab the ButtonClickEvent is set to a method that gets called if any of the three buttons is clicked.

The second tab is empty at design time. At run time, if you click on the button on the right side of the form a button gets added to the tab with different context menus and click event handlers for each button.

The third tab has a different context menu for each button.
