			  Graphite library, Version 0.8

			 Initial Open Source Distribution

===============================================================

The version 0.8 Open Source release of the Graphite Library corresponds to
the version 0.8 beta release of WorldPad, a "Graphite enabled" Windows
Application which has played significant role during the development of
Graphite and will likely continue to be one of the primary tools for writing
and testing new writing system behaviors in the Graphite Description Language
(GDL) on the Windows platform.

WorldPad 0.8 is availble at http://fieldworks.sil.org/WorldPad/worldpad.html
and is probably the best way at this time to "look at" the the Graphite
Library source.  If you are in a position to use the source as is, have fun.

Some preliminiary mailing lists for graphite can be found at
http://graphite.sil.org/mailman/listinfo.   Eventually the Graphite-devl list
will be the place to discuss how the library needs to be adapted to be more
widely usable.  Subscribe to Graphite-announce for news about future
distributions to address those issues.
