		<name iculocale="en">Genre</name>
		<abbreviation iculocale="en">D-Gen</abbreviation>
		<description iculocale="en">A distinctive type of literary composition. Different types of speech are appropriate in different situations. If the writer is exhorting his readers, certain linguistic forms are appropriate; if he is arguing or passing on information, other forms need to be used. The main genre types are (1) narrative discourse, which recounts events, (2) procedural discourse, which tells how to do something, (3) expository discourse, which explains or argues, (4) descriptive discourse, which describes some topic, (5) hortatory discourse, which suggests or commands actions, and (6) repartee or conversational discourse, which recounts speech exchanges. A long text will probably have a mixture of genres. A Gospel is basically a narrative discourse which includes repartee. In its speech quotations, there are expository and hortatory discourses. The expository discourse of Galatians includes a section of narrative discourse.</description>

			<name iculocale="en">Back reference</name>
			<abbreviation iculocale="en">D-BckRef</abbreviation>
			<description iculocale="en">Once introduced, there are differences among languages concerning how to refer to the participants. Perhaps a pronoun is used until a noun is needed to avoid confusion about the reference. But some languages might distinguish between participants with proper names, demonstratives, or generic words. A problem arises when readers refer a pronoun to the wrong person or do not know to whom it refers.</description>

Poetry is often characterized by extensive use of figurative language. Special format may help present the poetic structure.</description>

		<abbreviation iculocale="en">E-TV</abbreviation>
		<description iculocale="en">An addition, omission, or alternative reading occurring in another Hebrew or Greek manuscript. The original biblical texts were copied by hand and then, over many centuries, these copies were copied again. Each time a text was copied, a few mistakes might be made. Because of this, there are now many differences among the thousands of existing manuscripts. Scholars have evaluated these differences and have tried to determine which reading most likely represents what the author originally wrote. Many of the variations do not make a significant difference in the meaning. Some do, however, and in these cases the translator has to decide which meaning to translate.</description>

		<description iculocale="en">The purpose for a clause or sentence, that is, its function in making a statement, asking a question, making a request, giving an order, making a promise, etc. Normally, the illocutionary force is the same as the grammatical mood of the sentence: a statement occurs as a declarative sentence, a question occurs as an interrogative sentence, and a command occurs as an imperative sentence. Languages may skew these correspondences so that declarative sentences will sometimes communicate commands or questions, interrogative sentences may communicate statements or commands, and imperative sentences may communicate statements or questions.</description>

There might be separate sets of pronouns which are determined by the shapes and sizes of the objects they refer to.
