When they come home, at 5 or 6 their wife/mother gives the men a drink and later his food. There can be pieces of smoked meat.

The reason is that you have offended him and he wants you to consult him about it. 2) A dream. If you dream, e.g. that a crowd is sitting and wailing at someone's door, it may be a warning of |fv{puni}. So you will go and consult about it, in order to find out if it is true. It may be that your |fv{puni} is telling you not to go to the funeral of someone who is dying, because you would die there too. 3) Marriage. A young man may have asked many girls, but they all refused. He may consult and ask |fv{puni}'s help. He will need to sacrifice to this |fv{puni} that is manifesting himself as a new |fv{nyelye} (protector spirit) and is looking for a person to build his altar and 'fix' him. Also, if you take a woman without asking your |fv{nyelye}, he will cause your wife not to conceive. Need for confession and sacrifice. 4) No |fv{puni} yet. If you are a young man, and want to marry, have chickens, other cattle, prosper, you will ask your |fv{taguse} if he can help you. He answers that he only protects your life, so you'll have to ask your |fv{nyele}. 5) In case of sickness. 6) In case of accident. 7) When the chicken you sacrifice for firstfruits is refused by |fv{puni} of the field, you go consult. The |fv{nyele} may tell you that his advice to you this year is not to share any of your harvest with anyone.

\data The Telis think it is best to have a baby during the night, or before sunrise, or after sunset. When a baby is born during the day, they think it is |fv{kiro} - taboo! cf. Jesus birth, at night!

\data It seems that the blacksmith is also a |fv{puntase} (sorcerer). Unxare was one! Tilkhaane's father too. If you help a blacksmith you first need to drink a certain medicine to protect you. If someone steps over the legs of a seated blacksmith or his wife he'll get a sickness and might die. Such a sick person is not helped by other Teli.

\data When a person has been sick for a while, without improving or becoming bad enough to die, an old woman might try, late at night, in secret, to press the chest of the sick person so that he will die. She can even take a small tabouret, put it on the chest and sit on it to press hard and cause the death of the person. Young people are always afraid of the old women. When they're sick they don't want an old woman to stay with them at night. People start to resist these old ladies a bit more now and refuse to listen to them when they insist a person should die.
