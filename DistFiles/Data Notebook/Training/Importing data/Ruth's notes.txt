\title Arriving in Tyler
\rscr Ruth Schmidt
\type Observation
\loc Tyler
\data Last night we arrived in Tyler. Elsa and I left from Abada at 5 am. It was a very good trip. There are 400 km. of paved roads through to Badaki. From there it was dirt road but still very good. Elsa said it was the best she's ever seen it. They must have worked on it recently and there's not been a lot of rain in the last couple of days. We got to Barsa at 4 p.m. Barsa is a town of about 10,000. The pastor from the DPG that is responsible for the man assigned to the church in Tyler is there. We got to Tyler at a little after five and drove straight to Elsa's house. No one knew we would be arriving today. People began arriving almost immediately to greet Elsa and welcome us. These were primarily from Paul's house next door and Nathan's the other direction plus a lot of children from I don't know where. Paul is the Teli pastor who helps with the translation. Nathan is the Lela pastor under the DPG mission. His wife Julie was delighted to see Elsa. She is expecting. She is Lela also and mostly spoke French to Elsa but apparently is learning Teli as well. The house was locked up and Mark, who lives there, had gone off with the key so everything from the car was moved up on the porch and we then sat down to be greeted. One man on hearing from Elsa that I was staying for a while greeted me in Teli. I stumbled but managed the correct responses which caused great delight.

\data After Elsa got back from locating Mark and getting the key we moved everything in and started getting set up. Susan who helps them both with the house and with translation had recently cleaned the house but she has gone to visit her sister. While we were unpacking I found a lot of money under a towel on a shelf in my room. Elsa said someone must be hiding it there. A short while later Mark arrived and they discussed the news of the last 3 weeks. It seems that everyone had thought Elsa was not coming back 'til the end of Sept which Elsa had never planned on. Things have gone well and there have been no crises. Mark has taken on some sort of supervision of sporting activities in Tyler (he was umpiring a soccer game this afternoon). I'm not sure if it is the same group but a local society asked him to look after their general funds (the money I found) because he was raised with white women and everyone knows that the whites don't fool around with others' money and would have taught him the same.

He didn't stay terribly long - they mainly discussed the musical group from Barsa that is coming for the service tomorrow but that no one here knew about.

After unpacking we sat down to supper (Mark went into town to eat with the people he's been eating with while Elsa has been gone). Paul (who is Mark's uncle - FB) came. He is the Teli pastor. Elsa showed him the printed out Teli Scripture portions from Romans, Matthew (I think) and Genesis. He was obviously delighted and began reading them right away. He speaks little French so I know little of what the conversation was about. Elsa did say later that there were no apparent problems right now.

We turned in just after 9 p.m. and I slept better than I ever remember. I woke this morning at 6 with the chickens - and a goat walking across the cistern roof!

She was in a |fv{gbarma} (chair) with a scarf on her head and one tying her chin up. She wore small lip plugs. A |fn{pagne} covered her. In her lap was a calabash with plates and 3-4 times men came and dropped cowries into the calabash. Women were crying (3-4 actually and the rest moaning). About 50 women were seated around. A man was playing the balafon. Eventually 2 men joined him on drums and one hitting a hoe. 3 men, one at a time came and stood by the balafon and talked. The first had a coin (10 cfa) that Mark had given him and he held it up and talked and dropped it on the balafon. The other 2 were sons or very close relatives. They held cowries and dropped the shells on the balafon as they talked. They would speak and the balafon would play. M said the balafon talked translating what they said.

It seemed to be the ones crying hardest who drew the closest. The drums, hoe and balafon were much louder now. Some of the women would reach down and stroke the woman's shoulders and rearrange the |fn{pagne}. M says none of these things are buried with the body. I think he said nothing, not even a ring (or just a ring?) is buried with the body. They are buried naked as they were born.

It seems like everyone is waiting for something. M said a little bit ago that the young would dance later when it wasn't so hot. He also said something about true dancing when a person could die (the devil would kill him) if he got out of rhythm so only the very gifted danced. I asked when they started dancing and he said at 40-50. I gather they get practice at funerals. I'm not sure when they do 'true dancing'.

They're 5 feet or more long. M says they use a powder, without the ball, that they make themselves - just to make a noise. Rachel asked earlier if it was to scare away spirits but M said no, just to let those farther away know that someone has died (seems logical for the first shots after the death but those today seem more to be the exuberance of young boys who like to make a loud din - it may, however, help to draw more to the funeral as the dancing gets going). I asked M what they used before there were guns. He said no one could remember a time when they didn't have guns.

About 20 women have gone off with small pots, buckets or |fn{cuvettes} on their heads. M says each one represents the dead woman. They will go and get water and bring it back and pour it out. But now they've stopped about 50 yds. into the bush by a small tree. M says the |fn{source} is far so they won't come with real water. M says they're getting ready to dance.

Gradually the number of dancers increased (especially the children) and the young women joined them. Each woman had a long walking stick and at times seemed to be dancing with a particular man but other times there were 2 or 3 to one man or without a man. The youngest children (all boys) were only 3-4 and caused a lot of amusement as they tried to match the dance movement of the older men. The youngest girl at this time was maybe 13-14 and she had a stick like the others. This went on round and round for quite a while and all the time there were still women dancing right in front of the dead woman. The dancing lasted about 15 min and then the people went off to drink (M said).

In the dance area itself far more people than before are dancing - both men and women. Most are young but a few might be in their 30's or 40's. One fellow in a bright blue and white tee-shirt and dark glasses seems to be playing the buffoon. His motions are often more exaggerated than the others, he goes in the opposite direction at times and once danced wildly in between the balafon and drums. (One other young man had also done the latter.) Not all the women now have poles but there are many more of them. Some of the girls are younger than before. Quite a number of young men are blowing whistles.

I said we could wait a bit longer if he wanted but he said he needed to go out to his field yet that night. On the way back Mark said a number of things about the Christians and funerals. He said they have taken on too many of the customs of the whites. Now not only drinking is forbidden but dancing and the balafon. He feels this is wrong. The things associated with the fetish must be abandoned or those things that harm our bodies as temples of God but not everything that is African. He said Paul went to a funeral of someone close to his (Paul's) adoptive father. He went up and looked at the body and then went and sat down. He didn't go through any of the procedures of offering condolences (or possibly he did verbally I'm not sure - but he didn't offer a gift). Shortly he left. M says this has caused a rift in the family relations and made it impossible for these people to listen when Paul shares the gospel. He says the man today will remember that whites came to the funeral of his wife with a young man, that we offered a gift and gave condolences publicly. He says the man will never forget and will greet us whenever he sees us at market. He says he (Mark) will be remembered and when he shares the gospel at a later date he will be listened to.

\data When I got back we all (Elsa, Art, Mark, Janet and I) went to Mark's cotton field. It is coming ripe and some of the boles are opening but he says it's a couple of months 'til harvest. He was given a grant (from the Dutch government, I think) to form a cooperative. He says the land is his. Five fellows cleared, plowed (2 pair of oxen) and sowed the seed. Then they each worked or cared for a part of the field (100 X 100 meters in all but they weren't able to clear it all). The entire area is quite large. Some did not work as hard as the others and those that didn't work as hard Mark says he won't have in the cooperative next year. You can tell a lot of difference in the various parts. Some is very high, some almost stunted. This is due partly to differences in soil, partly because one section had been a pasture for cattle and partly because of lack of care. Mark, it seems is both ambitious and a very hard worker. We then walked down to his |fn{igname} field, which won't be ready 'til Dec. I didn't quite get the story but it seems that Mark didn't want corn planted also but Jason did anyway and then didn't watch it so every stalk has been eaten by green parrots.

When the music is played it is the fetish talking, even though it is a man playing the instrument. He said that that is why Christians don't use the balafon in church...because of the fetish. I asked why they couldn't use it before the ceremony to call the fetish was done, but he said, "No, everyone would believe that there was a fetish inside and be afraid of it." They only used drums and rattles in church. I remembered that Ev always shook a rattle when we sang during a service.

He wanted to be a Christian. He was at the service this a.m. and he now came with Paul to say he wanted someone to go with him to burn his fetishes. Elsa says I can go to see it done. His village is south of Gawa. We'll drive that far and I'll walk with Paul, Nathan and the fellow to burn his fetishes.

\data 8pm. We got back from Gawa at 7:30. I'm exhausted but what a great experience to have so early in my research. We drove over to Gawa before 2 p.m. Nathan, Paul and Matthew, plus Julie and 2 of Paul's children, Isaki and Rachael. The car was full. It was quite a ways. We went to the missionary family home there at Gawa. Nat and Willa Gaston and their 3 children. Elsa says they've been in the work for about 2 1/2 years, but have been at Gawa for only a year. He went with us to Matthew's village. Elsa drove us as far as the road would take us and then the six of us walked in. Paul, Nathan, Matthew, Nat, myself and a Teli man whose name I've forgotten - a Christian man who now works with Nat.|add{ (I've learned his name is Cava.)} It took about an hour to reach the village where the man had his fetishes. We passed through one compound on the way and greeted the people. When we got to the village we first passed through a fair sized compound where we saw no one. Just a little farther on was Matthew's compound. The only person we saw there was an old man whom we greeted. Paul talked to him but I don't know what was said. Paul, however, seemed happy about his response.

\rscr Ruth Schmidt
\type Observation
\loc Tansi
\data We went into a rectangular mud house in the compound. It was dark but we faced a place in the corner and Nathan asked Nat to pray, which he did (in French), claiming the power of God. The others gave responses but no one prayed in Teli or Lela. Then, in the name of Jesus, Nathan went over and began pulling things out of the corner. The space was walled in (diagram). First he pulled out a bunch of dried pods, then a bowl, some feathers and another bowl. Then they took a tool Nat had carried over - a short hand tool that Nat later said was for snakes in the path or to kill rabbits (diagram). It was only about 2 feet long. Nathan and Paul and Cava did most everything while Matthew watched. Though he did go get a short hoe at this point to make it easier to tear down the wall. There was a pot (with one of the bowls as a lid I think) and a rock that was important. The pot had been buried in the mud and had to be dug out. The mud from the walls was tossed outside. The bowls, pot and rock were collected and taken out. They then went to an adjacent corner and began digging there. I can't remember if there was a pot but there was a hoe head, a coin and maybe a gourd that were taken out of here. The feathers and pods and most of the mud were left on the floor. They took the things they had collected and went to an open place between the houses...oops, I forgot. When Nathan began pulling apart the first fetish he began by saying in the name of Jesus and I think put his pocket NT in the enclosure because as he was pulling things out of the corner he took a little blue book (like Gideons give) and put it in his pocket. At each of the fetishes Paul was singing and extremely happy about destroying the fetish. At the third fetish there were some dry branches which they pulled off in the name of Jesus and uncovered a pot covered by a bowl. There was earth inside and huge ants came pouring from everywhere but I don't think there was anything else inside. They dug under where the pot had been and there were a couple dozen cowry shells which Nathan and one of the others collected. (Still not Matthew)

\data Finally we went with all the pots, bowls, shells, hoe and gourd to a spot by a pool of water (just outside the compound) and piled them up. The old man was gone when we came out of the house but we now saw him and someone else watching from quite a ways away. The men commented that he had fled and that they were afraid. We now went to a nearby tree where there was a final fetish. They again pulled away some dead branches and dug down, pulling away clods and mud. All I saw them take out was some more cowry shells but I didn't see where the gourd came from and it might have been here. We went back to the pile and the dead branches from this last fetish were broken up. Even Matthew helped. The three older Christians broke up the pots and bowls and piled the wood on top and then poured some (?kerosene) on from a green bottle they had brought along. Paul started the fire but then gave some burning grass to Matthew so he could spread the fire over the fetishes. At each fetish the name of Jesus had been spoken and now Nathan asked for prayer I think. I'm a bit unsure. But then Cava asked Nat to give a verse to the new Christian brother and he talked for some time in French on the power of God as shown in Job and then promises of Jesus return etc. Nathan then translated some of this (I think) into Lela. They then sang in Teli clapping as the fetish burned. All looked happy but Paul looked joyous. Then Nathan said the fetish were burned and handed the cudgel to Matthew who then beat up the broken pots and bowls into bits. They then dug out the hoe and carried it home.

At one point Cava said that not all the bits and pieces were part of the fetish but it was necessary to dig and find the one important part - the little bit that was the fetish and that is what must be burned. Apparently the rock from the first fetish and the hoe from the second were such and I think the cowries from the last two. Before we left the pyre Nathan asked Matthew something about the 3 rings he wore on his left hand. He began pulling off the 2 brass ones but then there was some question about the silver one. They all agreed the rings were not fetishes but there seemed to be some reason for getting rid of them. Finally they gave him back the 2 brass rings and he left the silver one on. I don't know what happened with them after that. I also forgot to mention that earlier just before we arrived at the village Paul dropped back and then caught up with me and gave me a box with his watch in it to put in my purse.

\data Paul and Nathan came over last night briefly and I got a couple of questions answered about Sunday's trip. When they arrived at Matthew's village, which is called Tansi, there was only an old man present at his compound. They greeted him and he was pleased that people had come and he was glad to see the young man again (I saw him this morning without his sunglasses and he is younger than I had thought he was, though probably older than Mark). When he told the old man why he had come the man said that was too serious a matter for him to decide and he should talk with the elders. Matthew said that they were his fetishes, no one had given them to him and he owned them so he could do with them as he wanted. The old man was afraid of what was happening and fled from the village - though he watched from afar. As for the rings - though they can be fetishes - in this case it was decided that they weren't and they left them with the man. (I noticed this morning, however, that he was only wearing two, one of the brass ones was missing.)

\data Shortly after I arrived, I saw Daniel coming out of Gbasa's house. He went into Wulo's where he changed clothes (into shorts). He then went to between the new little house and the new chicken house he was building. He began working some mud that was already partially mixed. It had been covered with straw. Gbasa is sitting over by the fetish house and washing her baby's hair or at least pouring some yellow liquid over and over again over its head. He's lying in her lap. I went over to look. She has a pot on the fire with leaves floating in water. There is a stick coming out with cowries tied in rows around the top sort of like a rattle. She has a big calabash with some of the warm liquid in it and a bucket of cool water. She just keeps pouring it over and over. She says it's medicine. It looks like extremely strong tea.

A man came into the courtyard carrying a chicken. I've not seen him before. He talked with Daniel and then they went off. As I was wandering around the village I saw them come back from a tree a little beyond a tobacco patch on the far side of the compound. The chicken was dead. Daniel's a shaman and I think he just did some divining for the man. D brought the chicken and put it on a mud thing in the center of the court. He went back to mixing his mud and the man left.

That doors do not open to the east or west from which the winds and rains come, that habitations are situated along sources of water though some who know how to dig wells live farther a field. Houses are never built in a valley for fear of flooding and fields tend to be located on slightly sloping areas for the same reason. Areas that at first seem unprofitable for cultivation due to slope, rocky outcrops and poor soil are heavily congested while more arable land is ignored due to the floods of July to Sept. The lack of much useable land and the competition for it has resulted in wide separation of compounds or what he says are improperly called villages (3-15 houses). There is much rivalry between such groupings. Such a setting does not favor community feelings. He says 3 groups; the Dian, the Gan and the Dorossie have begun to concentrate more due to the influence of the Dolama.

\loc Gawa-Sabo
\data I should describe this house more precisely. It is about 14' by 9' with 2 rooms. The 'kitchen' is 9' by 6' and the bedroom 9' by 8' (paced off). The walls are mud about 8" thick and the inside has been plastered with mud and I believe dung to make it smooth, especially the floor. The walls have some kind of a lighter clay wash or slip from the roof down to from 2'-3' from the floor (inside). The roof is straw. The front door comes into the kitchen and is about chin height on me (I'm 5'9") but the straw extends lower yet to about shoulder height so I really need to bend. The door into the bedroom is also about chin height. The outer door has a wooden door with a lock (put on upside down). The inner door is just an opening. Both are very narrow. Ini can't get through the door with the medium |fn{cuvette} of water.

The only piece of furniture in the kitchen is a table that is knee height and about 3 1/2' sq. There are numerous pictures of Switzerland from a calendar Mark was given by Elsa and also some African drawings (scenes). There were some election posters, e.g. the mayor, but I removed those - I couldn't stand looking at those faces day in and day out.

The bedroom has a 'bed' consisting of a mud slab on the floor with a rounded lip covering 1/2 the floor space. Above the bed is the only window, a rectangle, about 15" wide by 24" high. There is a wooden hinged closure but the termites have totally undermined one hinge so it hangs loosely on the other. With care, however, one can still open and close it with a stick to hold it either way, i.e. the stick is simply held to the window by a cloth strip. When the window is closed the stick is turned horizontal to the inside of the wall and more or less 'locks' it - or would except for the missing hinge. There's a line across the bedroom lengthwise sort of for hanging things on and there was another shorter one over the corner above the table but I've replaced the latter with a longer one. Mark's things are piled in one corner of the bedroom. There are various nails in the wall - many of which I've made use of and have added more. It's hard working without shelves.

For a 3 and a 6 year old they know quite a bit about it but it's no wonder Konri and Binapena lost the roof on their house from their children playing with fire.

I presume they are all Daniel's but will have to check. I saw quite a number of leaves drying in front of Tiglo's house this afternoon but haven't checked if there are further plots by his house.

There are 2 cattle enclosures quite close. One is by the path to the pump about 30 yards from my house. Ini says these are Daniel's. Tonight I counted 8 full-grown animals with 3 calves. I saw about 5 of them go into the enclosure of their own accord yesterday but haven't yet seen who closes it up.|add{ (I found out it is Mida's son, Tiwu.)} The gate is 8-10 logs put in place over the opening. The other enclosure is on the other side of the house only about 20 yards away between here and the compound of Ini's cousin. She says these are Tiglo's cattle and there were only 2 head inside this enclosure tonight and no calves. There was just one pole across the opening with 2 planks leaning against it to fill up the space. Just at dusk I saw a very large number of cattle coming from the direction of the pump across the gully. At first I thought it was all one group but then they divided and one group headed toward the compound of Ini's cousin and the other toward the Lela compounds (but I believe both groups belonged to Lela).

\data Relationships. Labateux classifies the Lela as matrilinear but his description of their patrilocal residence system, and their system for inheritance of goods has led Goody to include them among the societies who practice double unilineal descent. In effect, each individual belongs to both a matriclan and a patriclan, each descending from particular ancestors. Relationships are hard to analyze as genealogical memory is weak going back only 3-4 generations. This is a characteristic common, however, in bilineal societies say Good and Harris. The two systems are not symmetrical. There are only 4 large matriclans while there are over 60 patriclans. The first are freely talked about, the latter are shrouded in an aura of mystery and often avoided as a subject of discussion, especially with strangers. A young Lela before initiation does not even know much of his patriclan, if anything. Only at initiation are the true implications revealed to him or her. The matriclan assures a ritual control over female fertility while the patriclan intervenes directly in the system of production. Land, houses, alters, and agricultural products are inherited in the agnatic line. Livestock poultry and money (both cowries and cfa) are inherited in the uterine line. This system of inheritance favors the patrilocal residence patterns and assures that those of the same patriclan reside in close proximity. Women, on the other hand, live with their father, their spouse or on being widowed with a married son or brother. But the matriclan being so much broader also assures that it is well established as well in each area.

\data She says that members of the same clan are united by several taboos and rites especially the |fv{duya} or initiation dance in which they reenact the migration from the Volta in reverse. Each patriclan has a fixed route and set villages they must pass through. In the latter are found secondary houses of the ancestors. It seems the crossing of the Volta is an event they want at no cost to forget. The members of a patriclan have similar taboos to the matriclan - don't kill each other, steal each other's wives or goods, etc. But the offense is apparently much more grave for members of the same patriclan than for members of the same matriclan. The sanctions are also more severe. Committing an offense against a fellow patriclan member risks being forbidden the right to participate in clan ritual activities, virtual exclusion from the clan in fact. A similar offense among matriclan members involves only temporary exclusion until proper reparation is made to the |fv{Watil} (matriclan fetish). It was recognized that accidents could happen in the armed conflicts and it was necessary for the one causing the accident to immediately ask pardon of the one he shot. If the individual died before he could do so then he was excluded from the patriclan. To avoid this skirmishers would change places if they found a clan member in their line of fire (Labateux). The Lela say 'among |fv{kuonbida} one cannot do wrong' and this corresponds to a certain reality in that migrant Lela seek (or sought before pacification) to establish themselves in villages where the majority of the members are the same |fv{kuon}. Clan members are not obliged to assist each other in case of danger or to avenge a death. However, the arms they use are the same as for the hunt. Each clan has its |fv{hul} (cry) learned at initiation, shouted on killing or wounding an animal. Each year at the end of the dry season hunters bring to their ancestral homes 'the meat of the cry', certain parts of large animals they have killed. Which part is brought is specific to the clan, e.g. neck, ribs, etc. They are not allowed to sell or even eat these parts outside the walls of the ancestral home. They are offered to |fv{Tilkha} in thanks for their luck, the efficacy of the poison, the 'rightness' of their shots, in other words, all that permitted them to kill the game. Members of the same patriclan also have in common the same process for poisoning their arrows though many of the differences are associated more with the attendant rituals than with the preparation itself. Again, one learns at the |fv{duya}, the appropriate procedure. Labateux says that an arrow, once having killed a man becomes sacred and can no longer be used in the hunt - but only against men.

Each rectangle was about 3" by 15" and they were laced about 2" in on each end so that they touched each other. The whole unit was flat in the middle but curved up at each end (see photograph). One end was higher than the other. This set of wooden "keys" were arranged over a series of hollow gourds of various sizes. This was all set in a simple wooden frame which kept the instrument quite low to the ground. The balafon player sat cross-legged in front of it while he played using two 12" or so wooden batons with rounded ends. I wasn't close enough to see what the lacings, or the baton heads were made of.

She was clothed and covered. Two |fn{pagnes} were folded and laying on her knees - there was a wristwatch on her right wrist. The scarf and cloth around her head made it difficult to see her face but she looked very young. Her four children were standing to the side beyond the crowd of women. The oldest, a boy, looked about 8 and the youngest, a girl on his back, looked about a year. The 2 in between were also boys. A young man played the balafon in front of the body as before. There were also 2 drums but no one was playing them. There were women crying and one going around through the crowd with her arms raised wailing. She was quite young. There were 300-400 people there, mostly sitting. There was no real singing and certainly no dancing. While we were there 3 men, all fairly young, talked over the balafon (which 'talked' back) and threw cowry shells onto it or into a bucket at the side. They sounded angry but I'm not sure it was really different from the last funeral I was at of the old woman. (This was in Lela but Elsa told me later that Mark told her that at least one of the men was angry and telling the family that they should not have taken her away from the dispensary and it was their fault she died.)

A large number of mostly women were seated facing the deceased and a great many more people were sitting or standing in clusters here and there in both sides.

\data 7:10pm. I decided I should go into the funeral of the young girl to at least see what was happening. It was clear at the other side of Tyler at the last group of houses past the market. The girl who looked about the same age as Irina (14-15) had been seated on a |fv{gbarma}. She had on a pretty dress (no |fn{pagne}) and a pile of clothes on the ground to her left looked like it could have been the rest of her wardrobe. There was a blue scarf tied around her head but none supporting her chin. There were large white earrings (buttons) on her ears. A bowl was on her head (the chair was against the wall of the house) but I couldn't see anything in it. There were more bowls covered behind her chair. An |fn{igname} was resting under her left arm and a 1000 cfa note was tucked into her scarf by her left ear. She was wearing a thin single strand necklace. A bowl in her lap was quite full of cowries and there were one or two unidentifiable objects plus a plastic sack of frozen juice the kids suck. Women were crowded around her and one used a switch to keep off the flies. Stephen's mother was sitting on her left.

The women were wailing loudly and some crying quite hard. The mother wandered in and out of the crowd looking quite distraught and calling something out over and over. She had a calabash of cowries on her head. Her hair had been braided. Another woman who looked enough like her (the mother) to be her sister also was quite agitated. A group of about 30 women and young girls were dancing back and forth in front of the body. Other groups of women were seated quite close. Men were seated in groups farther away. Three or four men 20-40 were also wailing at one time but it seemed somewhat ritualistic. One young man seemed angry, rushing about and people seemed to be watching him angrily. When the first dancing music stopped a woman (50's) stepped up to talk to the balafon and this young man tried to take her place to be first but she got angry back and he had to wait. She talked quite a while and threw down her cowry shells - but she spoke slowly without a lot of emotion. The young man was more abrupt when he started and he didn't talk as long. Another older man in a longer robe followed him. Then the dance music picked up again when 2 other men began playing on a hoe and a drum. There were more women dancing the second time, not just in front of the body but around to the sides also. Some of the women dancing were quite elderly.

When I moved closer to the body I saw that Susan and Kona and Nina were nearby. I also saw two other women I recognized from the church. I saw several men from the church off to one side: Nathan, Paul, Yoli, Mathias and Mark were all there but not really together. I saw Stephen also at one time. I saw at least 2 old women getting some of the others to sit down when they thought they were getting too worked up (or so it seemed). After the second spate of dancing, when the music changed, people began drifting away. It was beginning to get dark. Susan said she was coming home so I left too. It was probably not going to be much longer to the burial. In fact Elsa was surprised they had waited so long. I still heard shotgun blasts coming home.

When there are 2 drums with the balafon it is |fv{duya} and means that the person who has died was initiated. If an older person dies but has not been initiated only one drum is used. One can only use the 'irons' at the knees when the person has been initiated. Also an ankle bracelet of cowries is for the initiated. The men only dance when it is an older person who has died. It is to encourage the family. It is for people who die after 40-50 years.

\data Susan says that some infants are |fv{bii dirba}. They return after they have died. When a woman's baby dies and she's pregnant right away, it's probably the same child, if it's the same sex. He's come back to |fv{falake} his mother. Often such a child dies again, and a third/fourth time. You know that it is the previous child, just because it dies again. If he lives you know it is another.

People say that sometimes the spirit (|fv{tonre keya}) of an ancestor comes into a baby.

In case of the |fv{dirba}, people will try to scare/punish the baby by cutting into his cheeks, so he won't be nasty, but will stay! Some people, when they bury a small baby will cut off a finger or a toe, so that the next baby, if he is |fv{dirba}, will be marked (|fv{betike}) by it and will be easily recognized.

If a man's wife is not the same family she can still drink because she knows your 'secret', the sacrifice you make, etc. Other women of the same initiation family can come but not their husbands unless he was initiated at the same time as the man (age mates?).

The daughter of Trunako, his FB came in with a long rod. She knew he was there, she hit everywhere trying to find him. He was there against the wall and the rod hit him but he didn't say anything because she couldn't see him. He hid from 11-6. At 6 p.m. his older sister (Hepla) came and gave him some |fv{too} and told him to stay. There had been others looking for him before. At night he went up on the terrace but his brother Kyafi insulted him and his head and his hair, so he came down. The next day he went to school but on the way there were those who insulted him. When at home people would come to surprise him and hit him so he ran into the bush. One day a boy of Kyafi's age, Konfa surprised him and chased him. He went up into a tree. Konfa saw him and waited below. He told him to come down but Ev refused. So he began throwing stones. Ev was afraid so he came down. The boy grabbed him and hit him with a switch. He finally ran off. This went on and on. At times he and others slept in the bush to escape. It was difficult to go to school and he missed a lot of days. It's those who were last initiated who do the hitting and insulting and not the adults. Ev was 9. The school in Tyler started for 2 mos. in l970, the first full year was in l971. He was there at the beginning. This was now l973. All those not yet initiated had to repeat that year. The people who insulted and hit them must be of the same initiation family after the first 3 mos., e.g. the father of Aka is also a |fv{Vinvinda} like Ev, and was 24 or 25 at that time. He would come from Cobeta every 3-4 days to hit or insult him. But someone from another patriclan could not touch him after the first three months.

It doesn't go any deeper. The body is folded and lowered in and then extended into a laying position. There are several tombs in a village. A tomb will only be opened after 5 months 'when there is no more gas', no one could stand it after only a week or two. When an old tomb is opened, up to three may be put in without disturbing the earlier bodies. But then it is necessary to push the old bones aside to make room for the new to be put in a laying position. Only the head of the first body is left untouched. When the tomb is full (15-20 persons), if it is still in good condition, all the bones are removed except the skull of the first person (even if it is a child) and buried in a hole a ways away. Then the tomb can continue to be used as before. If it is fallen in, it is closed and left.

The family, and whoever desires, can come to see the burial. This takes place at dusk or at dawn, never during the day (except an infant). Only the |fn{grand féticheurs} are buried at midnight, e.g. Daniel would be. The gifts were all removed at the house and kept there. If it is an old round tomb the people don't like to put in the bodies clothed because that quickly 'dirties' the tomb. A man may be left with just his underpants and a girl her |fn{pagne}. It is common here in Tyler now to make a rectangular tomb like the Dolami normally do and bury the body by itself. It is not straight down like ours but dug down a ways and then a shelf dug into the side to put the coffin or body on. If the family has the means the body can be put in a box but this isn't necessary. In either case they can leave the body dressed because the tomb won't be opened again.

They say that when one is close to a dead body and its odor one can be attacked by certain diseases so one must take these medicines. They take them all together after the funeral while dividing the gifts given.

When someone dies all those of the team in good health go to the funeral. The team can wash the body and dress it if it is a man or the women of the village will do it if it is a woman. The team then takes the body to the funeral site or if the young of the village take it, the team will do the arranging in the chair, etc. The family don't do any of these things because they are in mourning. The family then brings the gifts to arrange around the body. After the tomb is open and ready for the body those of the team who want to dance wash and go do so. Those who don't want to may stay dirty to show they have worked. They have nothing else to do until the burial. When it is time for the burial the young of the village take up the body and take it to the tomb. The team chooses who will bury the body or the one who wants to will say so. Many of the team are willing to dig the tomb but don't want to put in the body. The one who wants to do it wants to show people he is courageous. The one chosen to bury the body undresses to his underwear. He goes down and arranges the bones to make a place for the new body and the others hand it down and he arranges it there. He comes out and the tomb is closed with a rock or |fn{canari}. A mound of mud is put over it quite high, so even after 2 years one can see it is there. 2-3 shotgun blasts are sounded to say it is done. All return to the house. The mortuary team get all the goods (gifts) left and take them to the house of the chief. They divide the meat first, cutting it up if necessary. Money is divided, etc. Each receives the same as the others. No one receives more. After all is shared out they will take the 'medicine' (to keep them from getting sick), which is prepared like a sauce, they may put meat with it. Everett says it is food that they put the 'medicine' in.

\title Consulting the dead person after a funeral
\rscr Ruth Schmidt
\type Interview

\srce Everett
\data Three days after a man's funeral the diviner is consulted to see if he was a sorcerer. For a woman it is on the fourth day. The family gathers together with the diviner to ask the soul of the dead if he/she were a sorcerer. They gather in the room of the dead person. They sit around the diviner. He interrogates his fetish by talking to the dead person to see if he has arrived among his ancestors. If 'yes', he asks how it happened that he died. 2-3 hours after death before the body is washed and dressed the body can be interrogated. The body is wrapped in a traditional mat, wrapped up completely. 2 young people take up the body one at the head and one at the foot. The questioner (the head of the family, if it's not he that has died, another old man then) uses a baton made of three straws tied together. He taps the middle of the body, calling the names of the dead. He asks many questions. Is all well in the compound? Is there a grave problem in the family? 'Yes' is right toward the questioner and 'no' is left away from him. He may ask what sort of death he/she died, etc. He can ask if he had done sorcery, etc. He can ask what killed him, e.g. the fetish, a person (but not who). After that the body is washed and dressed for the funeral. Children are questioned as well but not very small children because they can't tell what really happened.

\data Consultation of the fetish after a funeral. It is the third day for men and the 4th day for women. The family meets with the diviner in the room of the dead person. Others from the village may listen outside. The diviner sits facing the door and looks out. The rest sit around where they want. It's not important who sits next to the diviner. He talks to his fetish and interrogates him calling the name of the dead person. He first asks if he is well arrived and if there's news for the house. He asks if all is well in the house. He asks the fetish |fv{Tilkha} if the dead has done anything bad and then he asks the other diviners of the house, citing their names and asks if all is well with the dead, is there anything wrong. Each man is called and asked yes or no. If 'yes, he has done something wrong', theft, sorcery, etc. The diviner asks what he has done. If the dead says he's not arrived well he is asked what he has done wrong that he didn't find the right road. The person who has died has become like the fetish, a spirit. If he says he has arrived well among the ancestors then he is asked what caused his death. The diviner takes his left hand and takes the right hand of whoever is at his left. 'No' is when the two hands slap across his leg. 'Yes' is when the 2 hands dip to the floor. Then to check the answers he tosses out cowries. He throws 2,3 or up to 10. He said 5 is probably most often. All tosses are 'no' except when one out of the lot only is with the smooth side up and all the rest are turned with the crease up.

If the answer is 'yes, he is well arrived', he is asked what sacrifice they should make so that the ancestor will watch over the family well until the second funeral. He might ask for a chick to be sacrificed to a certain fetish, e.g. |fv{Watil}, a fetish of the family is often invoked. (The Teli name is |fv{Baal}) It could be a goat (but not a sheep) but not as often. They can then leave the house and make the sacrifice. After 2-3 days they convene again with a different diviner. They ask the same questions. If the answer is still 'yes' then there are no more consultations. All is finished now. But if a person (a close relative) who lived far away arrives several days later he may ask for another consultation. Ev says this is not so much to question the answer but to let the family know that he is there and is concerned.

At each meal, a part is put in the plate, after an hour or so the children can eat it. |fn{Chapalo} (beer) can be put there, in a bottle or gourd, and drunk after an hour. This is done until the second funeral. If it's a woman, a baton is cut and peeled and shea nut leaves are attached and this is leaned against the wall. A dish or two are put there for the food. This food is not 'changed' or more special after being there an hour. The children eat it as they would any other. They don't talk with or pray to their ancestors. This is all they do. After 7-12 months they make the second funeral. One must have millet to make |fn{chapalo}. It is put to germinate and then dried. The date is chosen, about 3 weeks later.

\data Witches. If an owl flies over the village the chief goes out and talks to the owl to see if he can find out why he's there. If the owl comes back 3 nights running then the chief goes to consult a fetish. One is born with witchcraft but Ev believes that it is given by the fetish. Yuri was a man who knew everything that happened in the village. He saw very clear but he didn't eat human flesh. He was at Cobeta (he's been dead about 20 years). At a funeral one day he was dancing and suddenly he changed into |fn{l'hyène} (a hyena). After 2-3 minutes he was himself again and continued to dance. Once he was asked to take a letter to someone in Brukasi, 10 hours by |fn{velo} from here. He had no bike. He didn't know what to do. He changed into something. Ev didn't know what. He left here at 7am and arrived at 10am. He gave the letter to the man who asked him how he came, he said 'on foot' and the white man didn't believe him. This same white man was coming back here by car and Yuri asked to go with him and the man refused. But when he left Yuri was in the car with him without having opened the door. But he wasn't in the form of a man. When the white man arrived here and got out of the car there was Yuri and he didn't know how he'd arrived. Witches eat the flesh of the men they kill, that is why they kill men. Others can fall from a tree and break an arm or have a great wound and rub it quickly and it is healed. He can see that things happen before they happen. He can change into other forms. The Kulaga people change often into lions, elephants, monkeys or panthers. He says the Lela people don't change.

I went with Ev as of 10:15 Friday morning and she was buried around 8:30 this morning. It is this latter I want to recount first. They brought the body out of the house and put it on the stretcher wrapped in a mat as before. The women wailed and waved their arms over her and then she was lifted up on the heads of the two women with |fn{canari} rings on their heads. Her son, Supata, who had said I could watch everything indicated I should come with him. Ev was waiting in the courtyard for me with Ann. It was primarily women who went. About 30-35 followed. He kept indicating I should get up farther in line or took me a more direct route than they took. 2x they stopped and two different women took over the load. Supata really laughed at this for some reason. The site was past several concessions on the far side of Tyler and out into the bush but not far from the Barsa road. The hole was just as Ev described it to me. It was fairly round and about 12 inches across. They laid the stretcher by it and some men began untying it. The women, except for the daughter, Kona, who had cried all night stayed back. Most of the men were from the 'mortuary team' Ev told me about. They had been waiting at the side. Her grandson, John, son of Kona, was there with the shotgun to mark the end of the funeral. I'd seen him come along on a somewhat different path from the women. The young fellow from Dorpama, Sifita, was also there. With Supata, I think this was all the men of the family. Supata had me come right up and I looked in. The shape was of a |fn{canari} as Ev described it and not deep. I could see bones and dusty debris inside. I couldn't see how far the sides were dug in. I only thought that the hole was too narrow for any but a child to go in. When they unwrapped her, a woman took her lip plugs, scarf and extra |fn{pagne}. They left her with a sleeveless top and a |fn{pagne}. She was beginning to swell about the face and neck and the odor was strong. A tall young man in his early 20's went into the hole feet first. He had to wriggle to get his hips past but was then standing with the hole not reaching to his waist. He went down in with his hands raised over his head and had to wriggle again to get his shoulders past. He had to then be practically lying in there. A short older man kneeled and looked down in and indicated where he should push aside the bones and debris. Then they lifted the woman to drop her in feet first, but got her facing the wrong direction. The fellow reached up his hand to indicate where she'd be lying. Down went her feet and hips, there was some problem with the arms and also a bit of difficulty at the shoulders but she was soon in. The young fellow came out with even more wriggles at shoulders and hips then all the men gathered round to see how she was placed but I couldn't see. I know from Ev that she was laid out on her back. Another man put a large curved bit of cement over the hole and several got rocks to fill in the cracks. There was a large |fn{canari} of water for making the mud to cover the rocks. Supata, and the other man began yelling at the women to go back (I think) but his sister wanted to stay and he let her. He then yelled at John to fire the shotgun over where he was in the bush.

I hurried back to tell Ev and Ann what had happened and we walked home.

So I went over to the dispensary. I found the nurse then wrapping it all up in gauze and couldn't see the cuts. I was told the sister wasn't there and was at the maternity so I went to see her there. She said she'd heard there was an accident but hadn't seen it. I said it was really bad and should probably go to Barsa. I mentioned he had it all wrapped up. She said he'd just sent for suture thread, very thick. So we went over. It was unwrapped and he was 'cleaning' it very roughly. At first it didn't look as bad as I thought. The worst tear was in the palm around the thumb. There were several smaller ones around the fingers. There was a fair amount of blood on the floor. The nurse was going to start stitching like that. Sr. Olga asked if he'd really cleaned it well inside and it was clear he thought he had. She asked John if he could move his thumb; he couldn't. Sr. Olga told the nurse he couldn't just stitch like that if there was damage in the muscle. The nurse roughly turned the hand over and showed he was cut all the way around the thumb deeply. Sr. Olga said he needed a surgeon and should be sent to Barsa or Budaki. She asked who was there to concern themselves with him. The young fellow from Dorpama said he'd see his relatives. The sister said he should find the money and a car and if they couldn't find the latter she'd drive but they'd have to pay her gas. He took off on a |fn{mobilette}. She told me after that the fellow might also need blood and I said he should certainly have it done under general anesthesia. I met Sr. Thelma coming back and she said she'd seen some of the family or friends who were very concerned that the nurse was going to try and take care of it himself. They had reason to be.

\title The sub-patriclan
\rscr Ruth Schmidt
\type Literature Summary
\loc Tyler
\srce Felton
\data Composition of the |fv{kuon} - the sub-patriclan. The patriclans are divided into two or more sub-groups which include the agnatic descendents of the ancestor that began the separation. The suffix -|fv{to} or -|fv{da}, is added to the name meaning those belonging to. But it is easy to confuse the sub-clan with the clan as the names are found in the same way. It becomes easy, therefore, to overestimate the number of patriclans. For example, the division of the clan |fv{Vivinda} into two: the |fv{Sekparto} and the |fv{Vivinda} is explained in two different manners though both having to do with the eating or not eating of beans. Today one group can eat beans and the other may not. Members of a sub-patriclan are integrated into the group at a determined time after their birth by swallowing a substance that is theoretically specific to that sub-group and represents the power of the |fv{tilkha} (patriclan fetish) which belongs to their group. This ritual, called the |fv{nuokhati}, is carried out by the man who has the social right to claim the child of the woman, whether actual father or 'social' father (man who has paid the bride service). There are also other ways of claiming children for the group. The children of an unmarried girl (where no man has paid bride-service) belong to the group of the girl's father unless she has fled his house and he can't perform the |fv{nuokhati}. In this case, if she joins her lover, the child can belong to the group of the biological father. The children born following adultery belong to the legal husband unless a divorce follows in which payment is accorded the first husband before the birth of the child. The first child of a woman promised since childhood to a man belongs to his group even if he is not the father. A girl often remains with her father until the birth of her first child and can receive visits from 'lovers', and her future husband, who may also visit her, is not supposed to complain or seek vengeance. Usually a young woman's sexual experience is with an unmarried young man of her own village. Finally, captives from wars with other groups are integrated into the group of those who have acquired them. No matter by what route individuals become members of a sub-patriclan the fact that they ate the same |fv{ti} confers complete membership and unites them with the founding ancestor and also to the founding ancestor of the main patriclan that extends farther back in the agnatic line.

\data Tell me about the |fv{nuokhati}. It is a medicine that is different for each sub-patriclan. It is given to a boy when he is three days old and to a girl when she is 4 days old. The father and mother give it. He gets up early and gets it. One burns a branch and crushes the charcoal and gives it to the child. He talked with Yoli and then said he had it wrong. The father goes to a relative of the same family of initiation who is old. He gives the charcoal himself as he keeps some by him. It's the same 'medicine' at the dance of the patriclan at a funeral. Each dancer takes a little bit in their hands and as they go around the body the leader tosses his towards the body and others follow suit. The child becomes |fv{Vivinda} when he takes the med even though he is not yet initiated, he is in the family. If an unmarried woman has a child it is difficult. If she's going to marry him there's no problem. If the child is a child of a stranger he isn't given the medicine. But when the child is older he can be initiated into the group of her father. If a woman is pregnant when married (by another) the child is in the group of the new husband. If a woman whose first child was illegitimate and given the medicine of the grandfather he continues in his grandfather's group even though she may later marry and all other children are now in his group.

\data The relations between sub-patriclans of the same |fv{kuon}. The sub-clans are linked through the ritual cooperation they manifest both at initiation and the purification rites that follow the adultery of a married woman. Women have fair sexual license before marriage but theoretically little afterwards. The payments a man makes even if parted, confer on a man exclusive sexual rights. A woman's infidelity is considered as an offense against the paternal ancestors of the husband. The sanctions involve the 'goods of the father', the bitter products of the culture, millet and sour water that is for making millet cakes. As a precaution the unfaithful wife must avoid consuming these products until she has confessed her wrong doing, named her accomplice and gone through the purification rites to reenter her husband's house. But a woman can prolong the situation by avoiding serving these things to her children or buying these things in the market herself and acting as if nothing has happened. But these are only escape mechanisms and eventually a wife must admit her fault as for example when someone is sick. The lover must give a goat, a hen, a chick and 500 cowries for the ritual, called the |fv{tokher}. Those who receive these goods are of a sub-patriclan different from the husband but of the same |fv{kuon}. It is they who carry out the ritual (described).

\rscr Ruth Schmidt
\type Literature Summary

\srce Felton
\data She says due to certain cultural features it is possible to discern a social unit more restricted than the sub-patriclan though there is no word for it in Lela. This she calls the patrilineage. The members are those descended from a common ancestor 2-4 generations before where the links are known and uninterrupted in the agnatic line. The patrilineage affects the double inheritance system. The goods transmitted in the uterine line cannot be taken by the principal heir until the quiver of the dead man has been removed from the house. The quiver is especially symbolic as it is identified with the man who carried it. Also the quiver becomes |fv{kha} (bitter) at his death until the heir takes it, which is usually not until several months after the 2nd funeral. The quiver is put in the game sack by the oldest son and hung in the room of the first wife or, if she is dead or divorced, a main entryway. The symbolic exchange between the maternal heir (MBS) of the deceased and the oldest son shows that the quiver is the support of the religious unity of the patrilineage and of its continuity. The son receives at that moment a little bamboo cane which must serve exclusively for the construction of the place of the cult called |fv{tre} (father). But the ritual |fv{kutre} (to make father) can't take place unless the deceased further shows his willingness by signs from beyond interpreted by a |fv{buhor} (diviner). Actually, the tie is not the most significant criterion of belonging to the patrilineage but rather the fact of invoking the same paternal relatives (father, grandfather) which permits those individuals to recognize members of the same patrilineage and to designate them as |fv{thiomena} brothers by the father. Several situations call for the intervention of paternal relations: e.g., the adultery of a wife, certain agricultural rites, the acquisition of a hoe, the installation of a family in a new village.

\data When a young man dies, and the father is still living, he may ask for a child to watch over his field. The brother may let him have one (the brother that will marry the wife). If she doesn't want to marry right away she can stay with her uncle (HF). She has no say over the children, except if she marries a brother she can keep them with her. If she marries into another family she can't keep the children. If the children are older, even in their 20's and married, the father's relatives (brothers) should take responsibility for them for a couple of years, longer if they are younger. Jerite, for example is still working for his FB. Even though Josiri said he could stay in Tyler now his work (millet field) is for Josiri and not for himself. The cotton field is his own though he'll probably give him something. When the older man decides it is time he gives the young man an axe and a hoe and he can work on his own. Ev says he was 20 when his father died but his father's family did nothing. He said this was because his mother was also |fv{Pudar}. If they'd been a different family, |fv{Nofa} or |fv{Pula}, for example, they'd have complained and something would have been done. They could have said something even yet but they didn't. His brother was only 11 (Padjete) but no one took him. He stayed with his father's nephew (his mother was related to Ev's father) but not as a son (?) When he was older he just left. Ev says either Supata or his mother (Koiya) should have taken them. He said a woman (FZ) can take the children and her husband can't say anything. It is the children of her brother.

\data Besides belonging to a patriclan each individual also belongs to a matrilineal descent group. They don't say they have a 'common mother', however, as they say 'common father' for the patriclan, and the individuals are |fv{tyarbieldara}. A person is said to inherit his |fv{tombiri} (skin) from his mother and those who belong to the same matriclan share the |fv{tombire lo biel} (same skin). Conflicts within a matriclan are referred to as 'doing bad to your skin'.

She names 4 clans, grouping them as follows: 1) |fv{Dou}, 2) |fv{Heni}, 3) |fv{Kabo/Kabi}, |fv{Nufe} 4) |fv{Pula/Sib/Some}.

Unity of the matriclan. Which group a child belongs to is not affected by whether the mother is married, divorced or 'unwed'. The matronyme bestowed |fv{Heni}, |fv{Kabo}, etc. allows each individual to recognize those who are |fv{biel} (the same) as he is and to adjust the possible disagreements that might arise in their social relations. Also it serves to hide the different levels of relationship in the |fv{tyar} that determine the place of an individual in Lela society and the links they can have with their uterine relatives. The integration in the |fv{tyar} includes then: 1) an affiliation of |fv{tyarlere} (sub-groups) that make up the matriclan 2) an affiliation of the 2 social groups (|fv{Wo} or |fv{De}) that make up each |fv{tyarlere}.

\data We took a completely different route. We left as if going to Paul's field past the |fn{sous-prefet}'s house. We went by Yoli's field quite a ways out where we saw and greeted Lena and some of the children. I assumed this path would eventually join up with the other one and that we'd go through the same pass. But we didn't. We never at any time touched on the path I was used to taking. The first part of the pass was by a dry stream bed that I would imagine has water in it after a rain and probably longer further into the season. The climb was steeper and very rocky but probably not more so than the other. I felt it was much prettier but, of course, everything is so green right now. The best part, however, was at the top when you could see through the trees to the valley below. Fields and meadows and patches of woods spread out to the distant horizon. It was lovely. At the bottom we came onto a hillside meadow where cows were grazing on the return trip. Much of the path from there was somewhat sticky from the recent rain and Susan took off her shoes since so much mud would stick. I'm not sure they got the rain at Gawa-Sabo because as we got closer the paths were dryer but obviously had been mud not long before. It was beautiful countryside and every compound we passed was new to me. We arrived at the far side of Tiglo's compound (from my house). Jaka passed us on a bike shortly before. Susan left our things in a house in a compound just before. I had heard a few shots and occasional notes on the balafon before we arrived but had not heard any the last few minutes.

She made 5-6 turns all around the compound. In the latter turns the wailing was more of a moan on inspiration. This seemed to be the pattern for each woman as she entered the first time, though some were more vocal and some less. The former tended to run in wailing loudly.

Before it was unwrapped, while it was being untied, Mark threw himself down on the body and then rolled on his back and writhed a bit wailing loudly. He got up and continued crying and wailing and very shortly after he again threw himself on the ground by Tiglo where he again writhed on his back. An older man with a big hat was going around crying and wailing loudly both before and after the first interrogation. One woman (35-40) was also very vocal. Others were quieter but a lot were crying.

Puregi was always very quiet and I'm not sure she ever greeted me. Kona has 2 children, Eri is about 6 and the boy may be 2 or 2 1/2. Puregi has a little girl with a huge umbilical hernia and she is expecting another. Throughout the funeral, Kona ran around the area where the body was, later occasionally joined in the dancing, cried very loudly and was generally distraught. Puregi never cried loudly or ran. Even when she walked around it was very slow and she would talk or sing to herself. When Kona walked slow like this (it is sort of a two-step) it was never quite so lethargic. Whereas Kona seemed to be constantly in movement and singing or crying out, Puregi would often just sit by Senra holding his hand or walked off by herself or with her child.

By 9 or so, some women had stretched out where they were to sleep. Some men were laying over by the closest round house and some eventually got mats to put down. At some point during this each of the wives came over one at a time to ask for my flashlight and headed over to their compound, I presume to check the children, as neither had theirs with them.

\data I asked if the |fv{kuontil} is the same as |fv{tilkha}. No. Each patriclan has its |fv{tilkha} but each patriclan chief has his |fv{kuontil}. It is to this fetish that the chief sacrifices for the children going to the initiation. It is |fv{kuontil} that kills a man who sleeps with the wife of a clan brother or someone who steals from a clan brother. |fv{Ditil}, however, will kill someone who sleeps with the wife of a man of the same village or who steals from someone of the same village. |fv{Watil kontin} kills those who do harm to their matriclan brother. Not if you sleep with a woman though. If a man doesn't want another to succeed he can go to |fv{watil} and make a vow asking that that person die. But if that person has done no wrong nothing happens.

\srce Mark
\data We got to talking about owls this evening and I asked, What are owls? Why are people afraid of them? Ev says it's an animal that can 'see' what is happening. It's not really the owl itself but the fetish 'pushes' it to cry when there is a problem. There are 2 sorts of owl. The worst is the |fv{kukurbi}. When you hear it near the house, you know there is a problem and you ask it, if it is traveling, to stop crying and go on. But if there is a problem it will keep crying, and if it continues you must |fn{charlant} with |fv{di} (the |fv{ditildar} or another diviner). Paul says if you are a diviner yourself you can divine for yourself but you always doubt so you like to go to someone else to divine as well.

The other owl is little and called |fv{wihu} and he cries everywhere. You chase it off and you aren't afraid of it. But the |fv{kukurbi}, if he comes, you ask it to leave and if it doesn't you try to divine and if he comes back you know it is very serious. But when you have 'adored' the fetish enough he will leave for good. One doesn't chase the |fv{kukurbi}, you talk to it. Mark says that if the |fv{kukurbi} comes and cries all night you know someone is going to die but he can be announcing other things as well, that someone has stolen, or committed adultery. It is |fv{ditil} that pushes him to announce. And the person has to 'arrange' whatever is necessary to take care of the problem. But if the |fv{kurkurbi} cries all night the diviner might be able to find out who it is but often doesn't say. If he 'sees' the person with his head 1/2 shaved he knows the person can be saved but if his head is all shaved it is too late. The first is a |fn{revenant}, the second has already left. This is true even if the person the diviner 'sees' is not yet sick.

\data Patrilocal residence (same village as the father). One reason for a man to build his own house rather than living with his father is the division of the fields closest to the |fv{piere} (house). In effect, the |fv{piere} is divided in equal parts corresponding to the number of married men. These then divide their portions among their wives. Each wife then plants in her portion various condiments (e.g. okra, squash, etc.). Too great a partition of these fields and too small an area for the women may be a reason for the father to approve a new construction. Normally it is he who chooses where his son will build, surveying the area of the village not yet occupied by other construction.

\data Residence of the son in a village different from that of the father. This possibility usually occurs when the |fv{daba} (hoe) was given by an adoptive father. In fact if his father is living, a man |fv{le} must wait for the authorization, advice or incitement to leave. He can't leave with his father knowing it. The ambivalent power (protection, misfortune) of the father justifies his authority and allows him to keep his son in a state of semi-dependence even though he's separated him from his unit of production. It is accepted that the son |fv{le} will help his father when he's in need (cultivate, etc.) and will let him take each year a compartment of his granary of millet or sorghum if enough remains for his own family. It is certain that a father will profit from these advantages especially if he lacks sufficient family labor in his own compound, but that doesn't exclude the possibility that he may |fn{donner la route}.

\data What can be planted in the various fields? He says you can put everything in all fields. Rice goes in low fields that get a lot of water. Or you can plant it near a stream. You can plant corn near a stream as well but early so you can harvest it before too much water comes. Peanuts are planted in sandy soil, as are beans, |fn{pois de terre} (a type of fat bean) and okra and squash. One doesn't plant peanuts or |fn{pois de terre} in the mountains because of the rocks. Both men and women can plant anything. Usually only men clear the fields and make hills, though there are women who do it if they have no husband. A man would be ashamed to have his wife do this work as people would say his wife did his work for him. Both can harvest everything but only the women bring it to the house in a |fn{cuvette}.

If he leaves without permission, the father will pound his chest and be angry and God (not the fetish?) will help the father punish the son. Some misfortune will come on him. But to go south without permission is another matter because the son will come back and even pay back any money that he stole to go. He says all the young do that. They never ask permission to go. They just take the money and go. He says if a son's already been once he might tell his father in secret that he's going again and ask help but never the first time. He says the father is only angry at his son for going to another village because it tells all the world that he doesn't respect his father - that he doesn't obey him.
