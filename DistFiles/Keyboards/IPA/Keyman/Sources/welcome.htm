<h1>IPA Unicode 5.1 (ver 1.2) KMN</h1>

<p>IPAUni12.kmx is a mnemonic keyboard definition which
enters Unicode values for IPA. This version
of the keyboard supports a mnemonic layout. This
allows a user to type with any kind of keyboard,
rather than just a US keyboard. </p>

<h2>Keyboard Layout</h2>

<p>The keyboard layout is described in terms of an IPA chart rather than a keyboard. This is because many base characters are typed as a sequence of a letter followed by one of <, > or = which are characters used to change a base character to another base character. Diacritics are typed as sequences of an appropriate key.  Details of the
keyboard layout may be found in the <span><a href='IPA Unicode 5.1 (ver 1.2) KMN.pdf'>"IPA Unicode 5.1 (ver 1.2) KMN.pdf" document in the section on
Keyboard Layout.</a> (PDF, requires <a href='http://www.adobe.com/reader/' target='_blank'>Adobe Reader</a>)</span></p>

<h2>Keyboard Installation </h2>

<p>Keyman 6 or later is needed for using the keyboard. Keyman's latest version is available from <span><a href=http://www.tavultesoft.com>here</a></span>. If you will be writing or modifying keyboards, you will need the Developer version. Otherwise, get the regular version. </p>
