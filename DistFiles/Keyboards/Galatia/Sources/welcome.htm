<p>GrkPolyComp.kmx is a mnemonic keyboard definition which
enters Unicode values for Greek.</p>

<h2>Keyboard Layout</h2>

<p>The keyboard layout is described in terms of a chart rather than a keyboard. This is because many base characters are typed as a sequence of a letter followed by one of =, ~ or ^. Details of the
keyboard layout may be found in the <span><a href='Greek Poly Comp Kbrd Layout.pdf'> document in the section on
Keyboard Assignments.</a> (PDF, requires <a href='http://www.adobe.com/reader/' target='_blank'>Adobe Reader</a>)</span></p>
