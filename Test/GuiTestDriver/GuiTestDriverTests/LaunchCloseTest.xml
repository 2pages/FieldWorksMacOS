<!--
	 Acceptance Test for launching, on-application and closing instructions.
	 The Desktop class is also tested since it forms the default context.
	 The launch id is set and retrieved from the TestState class.

	 They work together in the following way:
	 launch precedes the on-application context and is tied to it by its id.
	 close must be inside the application context as the last element.
