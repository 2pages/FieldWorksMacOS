<!--
	 Acceptance Test for on-application and closing instructions.
	 The Desktop class is also tested since it forms the default context.
	 Since there is no launch instruction, the application context must find the application that is running.

	 close must be inside the application context as the last element.

	 The Translation Editor application must be running before this test can succeed.
