<H1>SQL Unit Tests for FieldWorks</H1>
<P><I>Steve Miller, last revised: 11 September, 2007</I></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">For many years, no unit tests existed
for SQL code. In April 2003, I incorporated tsqlUnit to fill this
void.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">In April 2007, I started working on
using Python for SQL unit tests. The main reason for that was to find
a unit test framework that would work with both SQL Server and
Firebird, which we plan to port to. Python has the added advantage of
being cross-platform. The Python framework I ended up using was
unittest, otherwise known as PyUnit.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">As of this writing, the port from
tsqlunit to PyUnit is largely incomplete.</P>
<H2>tsqlunit</H2>
<P><A HREF="http://tsqlunit.sourceforge.net/">tsqlunit</A> is an
open-source testing framework for SQL Server. It has been abandoned
by its author, but the summer of 2007, someone was working to revive
it. In any case, it has been a solid testing framework for us for
years now. An introduction can be found in <A HREF="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa175796(sql.80).aspx">an
article</A> I published in 2004, which has since been sucked into
MSDN.</P>
<P>The tsqlunit unit tests for FieldWorks are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>tsqlunit test framework: \Test\tsqlunit
	</P>
	<LI><P>Cellar SQL unit tests: \Src\Cellar\Test\ut_FwCore.sql and
	ut_FwCore2.sql</P>
	<LI><P>Language Project unit tests:
	\Src\LangProj\Test\ut_LangProjSP.sql</P>
	<LI><P>Linguistics unit tests: \Src\Ling\Test\ut_LingSP.sql</P>
	<LI><P>Scripture unit tests: \Src\Scripture\Test\ut_Scripture.sql</P>
	<LI><P>Ethnologue unit tests: \Src\Test\ut_ProcsFuncs.sql</P>
</UL>
<P>If want to run tsqlunit unit tests:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>In Management Studio, select the database you want to test.
	(You'll have a mess you don't want to clean up if you install
	tsqlunit in the master database.)</P>
	<LI><P>Run \Test\tsqlunit\tsqlunit.sql. This sets up the framework.</P>
	<LI><P>Create the unit test(s). Examples can be found in
	\Src\Cellar\Test\ut_FwCore.sql. If you want only one, just create
	the one stored procedure for it.
	</P>
	<LI><P>In Management Studio, execute: <B>exec tsu_RunTests</B>.</P>
</OL>
<P>This will run whatever tsqlunit unit tests you have installed in
the database. There are variations on this theme, but this is what I
most commonly do.</P>
<P>tsqlunit has been incorporated as part of our complete build
process. The NAnt command is: <B>NAnt mksql-tst</B>.</P>
<H2>PyUnit</H2>
<P>The Python unit test framework is made of several pieces. Both the
SQL Server Python API (ipymssql) and the Firebird Python API conform
to the <A HREF="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/">Python
Database API Spec</A>. For more information how to use those APIs,
see the API Spec documentation.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><A HREF="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">IronPython</A>,
	which runs on .NET. In order for it to have the standard libraries,
	you must edit IronPython-1.1\Lib\site.py, according to these
	instructions from ironpython-differences4.htm: &ldquo;IronPython
	does not by default have the standard CPython libs on its path (for
	example, . You can fix this by adding these two lines to the site.py
	file in the IronPython lib directory:</P>

	Python. As such, it is fully available once the above edit has been
	made to site.py</P>
	<LI><P><A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipymssql/">ipymssql</A>,
	an open source Python API created to support SQL Server, using the
	.NET Framework Data Provider, and is <A HREF="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/">Python
	Database API compliant</A>. The source code is stored at
	\Test\ipymssql. For Python to see it, ipymssql\ipymssql.py must be
	copied under Python25\Lib\site-packages. I also have an egg-info
	file that goes in the site-packages directory, but I'm not yet
	convinced it's necessary.</P>
	<LI><P><A HREF="http://kinterbasdb.sourceforge.net/">Kinterbasdb</A>,
	an API to support Firebird that is <A HREF="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/">Python
	Database API compliant</A>. For Python to see it, it must be copied
	under Python25\Lib\site-packages.</P>
	<LI><P>Test\TestSql\ipymssqlfw.py, which uses ipymssql to connect to
	FieldWorks databases.</P>
	<LI><P>Test\TestSql\unittestasserts.py, a custom library which works
	around a bug in unittest when running in IronPython, and it also has
	a summary function.</P>

<P>The PyUnit unit tests for FieldWorks currently are:</P>
<UL>

<P>To run unit tests, you would, for example:</P>
