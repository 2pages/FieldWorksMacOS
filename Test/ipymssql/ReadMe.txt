ipymssql is Python support for Microsoft SQL Server. It has been submitted to SourceForge as
an open source project, and is pending approval. This is a temporary home for the project.

To work, ipymssql.py and __init__.py should be installed in the directory:

	\PythonXX\Lib\site-packages\ipymssql\

To guard against deleting the module when a new version of Python is released, the files have
been put here.
