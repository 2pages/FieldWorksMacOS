\vt From James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ:
\p
\vt Greetings to all God's people scattered over the whole world.
\s Faith and Wisdom
\p
\vref JAS001002
\v 2
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 1.2: |fr*
\vt My friends, consider yourselves fortunate when all kinds of trials come your way,
\vref JAS001003
\v 3
\vt for you know that when your faith succeeds in facing such trials, the result is the ability to endure.
\vref JAS001004
\v 4
\vt Make sure that your endurance carries you all the way without failing, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.
\vref JAS001005
\v 5
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 1.5: |fr*
\vt But if any of you lack wisdom, you should pray to God, who will give it to you; because God gives generously and graciously to all.
\vref JAS001006
\v 6
\vt But when you pray, you must believe and not doubt at all. Whoever doubts is like a wave in the sea that is driven and blown about by the wind.
\vref JAS001007
\v 7-8
\vt If you are like that, unable to make up your mind and undecided in all you do, you must not think that you will receive anything from the Lord.
\s Poverty and Riches
\p
\vref JAS001009
\v 9
\vt Those Christians who are poor must be glad when God lifts them up,
\vref JAS001010
\v 10
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 1.10: |fr*Isa 40.6,7 (LXX).
\vt and the rich Christians must be glad when God brings them down. For the rich will pass away like the flower of a wild plant.
\vref JAS001011
\v 11
\vt The sun rises with its blazing heat and burns the plant; its flower falls off, and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way the rich will be destroyed while they go about their business.
\s Testing and Tempting
\p
\vref JAS001012
\v 12
\vt Happy are those who remain faithful under trials, because when they succeed in passing such a test, they will receive as their reward the life which God has promised to those who love him.
\vref JAS001013
\v 13
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 1.13: |fr*
\vt If we are tempted by such trials, we must not say, “This temptation comes from God.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.
\vref JAS001014
\v 14
\vt But we are tempted when we are drawn away and trapped by our own evil desires.
\vref JAS001015
\v 15
\vt Then our evil desires conceive and give birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.
\p
\vref JAS001016
\v 16
\vt Do not be deceived, my dear friends!
\vref JAS001017
\v 17
\vt Every good gift and every perfect present comes from heaven; it comes down from God, the Creator of the heavenly lights, who does not change or cause darkness by turning.
\vref JAS001018
\v 18
\vt By his own will he brought us into being through the word of truth, so that we should have first place among all his creatures.
\s Hearing and Doing
\p
\vref JAS001019
\v 19
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 1.19: |fr*
\vt Remember this, my dear friends! Everyone must be quick to listen, but slow to speak and slow to become angry.
\vref JAS001020
\v 20
\vt Human anger does not achieve God's righteous purpose.
\vref JAS001021
\v 21
\vt So get rid of every filthy habit and all wicked conduct. Submit to God and accept the word that he plants in your hearts, which is able to save you.
\p
\vref JAS001022
\v 22
\vt Do not deceive yourselves by just listening to his word; instead, put it into practice.
\vref JAS001023
\v 23
\vt If you listen to the word, but do not put it into practice you are like people who look in a mirror and see themselves as they are.
\vref JAS001024
\v 24
\vt They take a good look at themselves and then go away and at once forget what they look like.
\vref JAS001025
\v 25
\vt But if you look closely into the perfect law that sets people free, and keep on paying attention to it and do not simply listen and then forget it, but put it into practice—you will be blessed by God in what you do.
\p
\vref JAS001026
\v 26
\vt Do any of you think you are religious? If you do not control your tongue, your religion is worthless and you deceive yourself.
\vref JAS001027
\v 27
\vt What God the Father considers to be pure and genuine religion is this: to take care of orphans and widows in their suffering and to keep oneself from being corrupted by the world.

\s Warning against Prejudice
\p
\vref JAS002001
\v 1
\vt My friends, as believers in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, you must never treat people in different ways according to their outward appearance.
\vref JAS002002
\v 2
\vt Suppose a rich man wearing a gold ring and fine clothes comes to your meeting, and a poor man in ragged clothes also comes.
\vref JAS002003
\v 3
\vt If you show more respect to the well-dressed man and say to him, “Have this best seat here,” but say to the poor man, “Stand over there, or sit here on the floor by my feet,”
\vref JAS002004
\v 4
\vt then you are guilty of creating distinctions among yourselves and of making judgments based on evil motives.
\p
\vref JAS002005
\v 5
\vt Listen, my dear friends! God chose the poor people of this world to be rich in faith and to possess the kingdom which he promised to those who love him.
\vref JAS002006
\v 6
\vt But you dishonor the poor! Who are the ones who oppress you and drag you before the judges? The rich!
\vref JAS002007
\v 7
\vt They are the ones who speak evil of that good name which has been given to you.
\p
\vref JAS002008
\v 8
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 2.8: |fr*Lev 19.18.
\vt You will be doing the right thing if you obey the law of the Kingdom, which is found in the scripture, “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.”
\vref JAS002009
\v 9
\vt But if you treat people according to their outward appearance, you are guilty of sin, and the Law condemns you as a lawbreaker.
\vref JAS002010
\v 10
\vt Whoever breaks one commandment is guilty of breaking them all.
\vref JAS002011
\v 11
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 2.11: |fr*a Exo 20.14; Deu 5.18; b Exo 20.13; Deu 5.17.
\vt For the same one who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not commit murder.” Even if you do not commit adultery, you have become a lawbreaker if you commit murder.
\vref JAS002012
\v 12
\vt Speak and act as people who will be judged by the law that sets us free.
\vref JAS002013
\v 13
\vt For God will not show mercy when he judges the person who has not been merciful; but mercy triumphs over judgment.
\s Faith and Actions
\p
\vref JAS002014
\v 14
\vt My friends, what good is it for one of you to say that you have faith if your actions do not prove it? Can that faith save you?
\vref JAS002015
\v 15
\vt Suppose there are brothers or sisters who need clothes and don't have enough to eat.
\vref JAS002016
\v 16
\vt What good is there in your saying to them, “God bless you! Keep warm and eat well!”—if you don't give them the necessities of life?
\vref JAS002017
\v 17
\vt So it is with faith: if it is alone and includes no actions, then it is dead.
\p
\vref JAS002018
\v 18
\vt But someone will say, “One person has faith, another has actions.” My answer is, “Show me how anyone can have faith without actions. I will show you my faith by my actions.”
\vref JAS002019
\v 19
\vt Do you believe that there is only one God? Good! The demons also believe—and tremble with fear.
\vref JAS002020
\v 20
\vt You fool! Do you want to be shown that faith without actions is useless?
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 2.20: |fr*a |fq useless; |fq*some manuscripts have |fq dead.|fq*
\vt
\vref JAS002021
\v 21
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 2.21: |fr*Gen 22.1-14
\vt How was our ancestor Abraham put right with God? It was through his actions, when he offered his son Isaac on the altar.
\vref JAS002022
\v 22
\vt Can't you see? His faith and his actions worked together; his faith was made perfect through his actions.
\vref JAS002023
\v 23
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 2.23: |fr*a Gen 15.6; b 2Ch 20.7; Isa 41.8.
\vt And the scripture came true that said, “Abraham believed God, and because of his faith God accepted him as righteous.” And so Abraham was called God's friend.
\vref JAS002024
\v 24
\vt You see, then, that it is by our actions that we are put right with God, and not by our faith alone.
\p
\vref JAS002025
\v 25
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 2.25: |fr*Jas 2.1-21.
\vt It was the same with the prostitute Rahab. She was put right with God through her actions, by welcoming the Israelite spies and helping them to escape by a different road.
\p
\vref JAS002026
\v 26
\vt So then, as the body without the spirit is dead, also faith without actions is dead.

\s The Tongue
\p
\vref JAS003001
\v 1
\vt My friends, not many of you should become teachers. As you know, we teachers will be judged with greater strictness than others.
\vref JAS003002
\v 2
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 3.2: |fr*
\vt All of us often make mistakes. But if a person never makes a mistake in what he says, he is perfect and is also able to control his whole being.
\vref JAS003003
\v 3
\vt We put a bit into the mouth of a horse to make it obey us, and we are able to make it go where we want.
\vref JAS003004
\v 4
\vt Or think of a ship: big as it is and driven by such strong winds, it can be steered by a very small rudder, and it goes wherever the pilot wants it to go.
\vref JAS003005
\v 5
\vt So it is with the tongue: small as it is, it can boast about great things.
\p
\vt Just think how large a forest can be set on fire by a tiny flame!
\vref JAS003006
\v 6
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 3.6: |fr*
\vt And the tongue is like a fire. It is a world of wrong, occupying its place in our bodies and spreading evil through our whole being. It sets on fire the entire course of our existence with the fire that comes to it from hell itself.
\vref JAS003007
\v 7
\vt We humans are able to tame and have tamed all other creatures—wild animals and birds, reptiles and fish.
\vref JAS003008
\v 8
\vt But no one has ever been able to tame the tongue. It is evil and uncontrollable, full of deadly poison.
\vref JAS003009
\v 9
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 3.9: |fr*Gen 1.26.
\vt We use it to give thanks to our Lord and Father and also to curse other people, who are created in the likeness of God.
\vref JAS003010
\v 10
\vt Words of thanksgiving and cursing pour out from the same mouth. My friends, this should not happen!
\vref JAS003011
\v 11
\vt No spring of water pours out sweet water and bitter water from the same opening.
\vref JAS003012
\v 12
\vt A fig tree, my friends, cannot bear olives; a grapevine cannot bear figs, nor can a salty spring produce sweet water.
\s The Wisdom from Above
\p
\vref JAS003013
\v 13
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 3.13: |fr*
\vt Are there any of you who are wise and understanding? You are to prove it by your good life, by your good deeds performed with humility and wisdom.
\vref JAS003014
\v 14
\vt But if in your heart you are jealous, bitter, and selfish, don't sin against the truth by boasting of your wisdom.
\vref JAS003015
\v 15
\vt Such wisdom does not come down from heaven; it belongs to the world, it is unspiritual and demonic.
\vref JAS003016
\v 16
\vt Where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is also disorder and every kind of evil.
\vref JAS003017
\v 17
\vt But the wisdom from above is pure first of all; it is also peaceful, gentle, and friendly; it is full of compassion and produces a harvest of good deeds; it is free from prejudice and hypocrisy.
\vref JAS003018
\v 18
\vt And goodness is the harvest that is produced from the seeds the peacemakers plant in peace.

\s Friendship with the World
\p
\vref JAS004001
\v 1
\vt Where do all the fights and quarrels among you come from? They come from your desires for pleasure, which are constantly fighting within you.
\vref JAS004002
\v 2
\vt You want things, but you cannot have them, so you are ready to kill; you strongly desire things, but you cannot get them, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have what you want because you do not ask God for it.
\vref JAS004003
\v 3
\vt And when you ask, you do not receive it, because your motives are bad; you ask for things to use for your own pleasures.
\vref JAS004004
\v 4
\vt Unfaithful people! Don't you know that to be the world's friend means to be God's enemy? If you want to be the world's friend, you make yourself God's enemy.
\vref JAS004005
\v 5
\vt Don't think that there is no truth in the scripture that says, “The spirit that God placed in us is filled with fierce desires.”
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 4.5: |fr*b |fq The spirit...fierce desires; |fq*or |fq God yearns jealously over the spirit that he placed in us.|fq*
\vt
\vref JAS004006
\v 6
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 4.6: |fr*Pro 3.34 (LXX).
\vt But the grace that God gives is even stronger. As the scripture says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”
\p
\vref JAS004007
\v 7
\vt So then, submit yourselves to God. Resist the Devil, and he will run away from you.
\vref JAS004008
\v 8
\vt Come near to God, and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners! Purify your hearts, you hypocrites!
\vref JAS004009
\v 9
\vt Be sorrowful, cry, and weep; change your laughter into crying, your joy into gloom!
\vref JAS004010
\v 10
\vt Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
\s Warning against Judging One Another
\p
\vref JAS004011
\v 11
\vt Do not criticize one another, my friends. If you criticize or judge another Christian, you criticize and judge the Law. If you judge the Law, then you are no longer one who obeys the Law, but one who judges it.
\vref JAS004012
\v 12
\vt God is the only lawgiver and judge. He alone can save and destroy. Who do you think you are, to judge someone else?
\s Warning against Boasting
\p
\vref JAS004013
\v 13
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 4.13: |fr*Pro 27.1.
\vt
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 4.13: |fr*
\vt Now listen to me, you that say, “Today or tomorrow we will travel to a certain city, where we will stay a year and go into business and make a lot of money.”
\vref JAS004014
\v 14
\vt You don't even know what your life tomorrow will be! You are like a puff of smoke, which appears for a moment and then disappears.
\vref JAS004015
\v 15
\vt What you should say is this: “If the Lord is willing, we will live and do this or that.”
\vref JAS004016
\v 16
\vt But now you are proud, and you boast; all such boasting is wrong.
\p
\vref JAS004017
\v 17
\vt So then, if we do not do the good we know we should do, we are guilty of sin.

\s Warning to the Rich

\vt And now, you rich people, listen to me! Weep and wail over the miseries that are coming upon you!
\vref JAS005002
\v 2
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 5.2: |fr*Mat 6.19.
\vt Your riches have rotted away, and your clothes have been eaten by moths.
\vref JAS005003
\v 3
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 5.3: |fr*
\vt Your gold and silver are covered with rust, and this rust will be a witness against you and will eat up your flesh like fire. You have piled up riches in these last days.
\vref JAS005004
\v 4
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 5.4: |fr*Deu 24.14,15.
\vt You have not paid any wages to those who work in your fields. Listen to their complaints! The cries of those who gather in your crops have reached the ears of God, the Lord Almighty.
\vref JAS005005
\v 5
\vt Your life here on earth has been full of luxury and pleasure. You have made yourselves fat for the day of slaughter.
\vref JAS005006

\f |fm +|fm*|fr 5.6: |fr*
\vt You have condemned and murdered innocent people, and they do not resist you.

\s Patience and Prayer
\p
\vref JAS005007
\v 7
\vt Be patient, then, my friends, until the Lord comes. See how patient farmers are as they wait for their land to produce precious crops. They wait patiently for the autumn and spring rains.
\vref JAS005008
\v 8
\vt You also must be patient. Keep your hopes high, for the day of the Lord's coming is near.
\p
\vref JAS005009
\v 9
\vt Do not complain against one another, my friends, so that God will not judge you. The Judge is near, ready to appear.
\vref JAS005010
\v 10
\vt My friends, remember the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. Take them as examples of patient endurance under suffering.
\vref JAS005011
\v 11
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 5.11: |fr*a Job 1.21,22; 2.10; b Psa 103.8.
\vt We call them happy because they endured. You have heard of Job's patience, and you know how the Lord provided for him in the end. For the Lord is full of mercy and compassion.
\p
\vref JAS005012
\v 12
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 5.12: |fr*Mat 5.34-37.
\vt Above all, my friends, do not use an oath when you make a promise. Do not swear by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Say only “Yes” when you mean yes, and “No” when you mean no, and then you will not come under God's judgment.
\p
\vref JAS005013
\v 13
\vt Are any among you in trouble? They should pray. Are any among you happy? They should sing praises.
\vref JAS005014
\v 14
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 5.14: |fr*Mrk 6.13.
\vt Are any among you sick? They should send for the church elders, who will pray for them and rub olive oil on them in the name of the Lord.
\vref JAS005015
\v 15
\vt This prayer made in faith will heal the sick; the Lord will restore them to health, and the sins they have committed will be forgiven.
\vref JAS005016
\v 16
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 5.16: |fr*
\vt So then, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you will be healed. The prayer of a good person has a powerful effect.
\vref JAS005017
\v 17
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 5.17: |fr*1Ki 17.1; 18.1
\vt Elijah was the same kind of person as we are. He prayed earnestly that there would be no rain, and no rain fell on the land for three and a half years.
\vref JAS005018
\v 18
\f |fm +|fm*|fr 5.18: |fr*1Ki 18.42-45.
