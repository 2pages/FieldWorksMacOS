 <definition>
  <p>A "bug" is a name for a software failure. In particular, a bug is identified by the execution of a test step that fails to produce the expected result. Bugs can be anticipated by identifying <i>quality risks</i>. When testing focuses on parts of a program with higher risk factors, more significant bugs can be found with less effort.</p>
