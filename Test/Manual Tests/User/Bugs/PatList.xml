 <label name="List of Bug Patterns">
  <p>The following is typical of a list of bug patterns extracted from the XML source of the testscripts. They are organized by library and shortened in form to save space. This one is very short, just to give you an idea of what they look like.</p>

  <p name="startup22.1"><i>Title:</i> Start Up: Empty Project dialog does not open correctly</p>
  <p><i>Actions:</i> Create a new project or delete all the entries of an existing project to get a project that contains no entries. (Or do the same with list items for a list in TLE).</p>
