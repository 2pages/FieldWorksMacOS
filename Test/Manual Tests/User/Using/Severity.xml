 <introduction>
  <p>Severity measures impact of the bug on the system under test not considering user perspective.</p>
 </introduction>
 <guidelines>
  <p>If the severity is not indicated in the bug pattern, here are some guidelines to identify the severity level of a bug:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>Assign 1 "Fatal" if the program crashes or data is lost or corrupted or there is a safety-related failure</li>
	<li>Assign 2 "Severe" if the program fails to meet the specifications in a way that affects a user's ability to get work done and there is no reasonable workaround</li>
	<li>Assign 3 "Minor" if the program fails to meet specifications in a less significant way</li>
  </ul>
 </guidelines>
