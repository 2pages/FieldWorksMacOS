 <introduction>
  <p>Each test case step that can result in a reportable bug has a pattern for reporting that bug. More than one bug pattern may be associated with a step. For most bugs, you will find and use one of the anticipated <link uri="..\Bugs\Pattern.xml" type="module">bug patterns</link> when reporting.</p>
 </introduction>
 <prerequisites>
  <p>Before you begin, make sure you have:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A second copy of this manual open to the test case step that failed.</li>
   <li>A text editor open, ready for entering a bug report.</li>
  </ul>
 </prerequisites>
 <steps>
  <p>Here are the steps to follow when reporting a software bug to the <link uri="..\Milestone\LSTD.xml" type="module">Language Software Test Department</link>:</p>
  <step>On the test case step which failed, click the link to its bug patterns.</step>
  <step link="Related bugs" uri="Related.xml">If you have access to the bug tracking system, find a similar bug using the information in the bug pattern action or category. You may be able to add your new information to that bug.</step>
  <step>Cut-and-paste the appropriate bug pattern from the manual to the top of the document in your editor.<p>Bugs will appear in reverse order, but you won't lose your place as easily.</p></step>
  <step link="Details" uri="Fields.xml">For many bugs, the fields in the pattern are already filled in. For lower-level or more general bugs, you may have to supply this data.</step>
  <step link="Submit" uri="Submit.xml">When you have finished testing, save your document for submission.</step>
 </steps>
