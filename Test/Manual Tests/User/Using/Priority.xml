 <introduction>
  <p>Priority measures impact on the customer.</p>
 </introduction>
 <guidelines>
  <p>If the priority is not indicated in the bug pattern, here are some guidelines to identify the priority level of a bug:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>Assign 1 "Blocking" if testing can't proceed until fixed</li>
	<li>Assign 2 "High" if the bug needs to be fixed quite urgently</li>
	<li>Assign 3 "Medium" if it is a significant problem that should be fixed before shipping</li>
	<li>Assign 4 "Low" if it is not hindering to the user and can wait until after a release to be fixed</li>
	<li>Assign 5 "Nice to have" if fixing it can wait until there's nothing better to do</li>
  </ul>
 </guidelines>
