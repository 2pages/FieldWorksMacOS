 <introduction>
  <p>A good bug description often leads a software developer straight to the cause of the bug. Unlike the <link uri="Name.xml" type="module">name of the bug</link> which gives a one-line description of the bug, the description includes a great deal of detail. The <link uri="..\Bugs\Pattern.xml" type="module">bug pattern</link> for each listed bug usually has a fairly well fleshed out description. Use the guidelines below to fill in blank sections or add to it.</p>

 <warning>
  <p>It is the developer's job to debug - avoid the temptation to dig too deeply!</p>
 </warning>
 <guidelines>
  <p>Here are some guidelines for describing bugs:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>Tell about any extra steps you performed.</li>
	<li>Tell about any steps you omitted.</li>
	<li>Write about the order in which you executed steps leading to the failure<p name="Tip">To see if the order of steps is significant, execute the steps in different orders.</p></li>
	<li>Write about any behaviors not listed in the result.</li>
	<li>If you know something about programming, it's OK to guess at a general cause by phrases such as, "acts like a pointer is not initialized", but don't fail to tell why you feel that way.</li>
  </ul>
 </guidelines>
