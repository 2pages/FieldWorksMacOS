 <introduction>
  <p>Good bug report names help developers quickly identify the general part of their code the bug occurred in. Most bug patterns have a suggested name pattern with slots indicating what ought to fill them. But sometimes it is still not obvious how to fill a slot. The guidelines below may help in cases of slot confusion and where there is no name pattern.</p>
 </introduction>
 <guidelines>
  <p>Here are some guidelines for naming bug reports:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The name of the interface object or feature should be first in the name. Capitalize the first letter.</li>
   <li>If there are a few major test cases or types of the object, a qualifying word should come after the object name, preceeded by a colon ":". E.g., <i>Format toolbar appearance .. </i> or <i>Format toolbar: font size ..</i></li>
   <li>Use a couple of words to give an idea of what action caused the failure.</li>
   <li>Normally at the end, use a couple of words or words from a failure message to tell what the failure was or what the resulting behavior was.</li>
  </ul>
 </guidelines>
