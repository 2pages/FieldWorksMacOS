 <definition>
  <p>On a Windows computer, a batch file is essentially a throw-back to the DOS era. It is a line-oriented set of DOS 6.2 commands (with a few new ones added). When executed, it performs its instructions line-by-line until there is an untrapped error or the instructions are exhausted.</p>
<p>Here are some reasons we use batch files:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Though somewhat archaic, every Windows operating system can run a batch file when it is double-clicked.</li>
   <li>They tend to be only a few lines long and do simple things like launch a program with a specific set of parameters.</li>
   <li>More complex, albeit small, programs would have to be written to do the same things otherwise.</li>
  </ul>
