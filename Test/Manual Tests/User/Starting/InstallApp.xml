  <p>Here are the steps to install a FieldWorks application:</p>
  <step>Double click the "setup.exe" file you downloaded. It is a self-extracting compressed file.</step>
  <step>Let the installation program lead you through the installation. You will need to choose a location for the program.<p>A subfolder of the "Program Files" system folder is recommended, the installation program will create it for you.</p></step>
  <step>If this is the first time you have installed a FieldWorks application, install the MSDE server software if prompted (this may install automatically). Most FieldWorks software requires it. Presently, WorldPad does not.</step>
