<!-- Step 1.1 -->
  <step name="1.1" link="Bug">

	Observe the current number of records displayed in the status bar (the N in M/N).  While in DE view, select Insert Event (from Insert menu or toolbar).

	<r>DE view remains in effect.  A new record is displayed, with the caption "Event - Data Entry".  Its Event Type is "Observation"; the other fields are empty.  The visible fields are those which are "Always" visible by default (Title, Event Type, Description, Anthropology Codes, Date of Event, Participants , Locations, Confidence, Researchers), as specified in DN <link uri="http://lsdev.sil.org/intranet/FwSpecs/FW/Notebooks/Features/DataEntry/DataEntryView.html" type="doc">DN Data Entry View</link>
 - unless visibility settings have been changed.  The record number displayed in the lower right corner in the status bar is N+1/N+1, e.g. 11/11. (This assumes that the
default sort [by creation date] is in effect: the record just created is ordered last.) </r>

<!-- Step 1.2 -->
  <step name="1.2" link="Bug">

	Observe the current number of records displayed in the status bar.  While in Browse view, select Insert Event (from Insert menu or toolbar).

	<r>View switches to DE.  Other than that, same result as in 1.1.</r>

<!-- Step 2.1 -->
  <step name="2.1" link="Bug">

	After inserting a new event entry, change to Doc or Browse mode.  Look for the new event entry.

	<r>The new entry should be available from all modes. </r>

<!-- Step 2.2.0 -->
  <step name="2.2.0" link="Bug">

	While a filter is in effect that excludes empty records, select Insert Event.

	<r> A warning dialog appears, saying, "This action requires that Filters be turned off." (If this dialog doesn't appear, the "Do not show" checkbox may have been
 checked already. You can undo this by exiting DN, deleting the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SIL\FieldWorks\Data Notebook\Filter Dialog key
in the registry, and restarting DN.)</r>
