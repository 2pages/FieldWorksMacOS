  <introduction>
   <p>A color pallet allows the visual selection of a color from a compact frame. A text box or read-only label is associated with each color pallet. When the pallet is not permanently displayed on the control frame, a drop-down triangle widget is used to access the pallet. Keystrokes allow operation when there is no pointer device.</p>
   <p name="Specification">See <link uri="http://lsdev.sil.org/intranet/FwSpecs/FW/App/Features/Toolbars/FormattingToolbar.html#Formatting-Background Color" type="doc">Formatting-Background Color</link>.</p>
 </introduction>
  <context>
   <p>Each color pallet is tested with its associated control so that side-effects can be noted. Testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "color pallet". See <link uri="textbox.xml" type="module">Text Box Tests</link> to test the associated text box, if any.</p>
