  <introduction>
<p>A spin control is an input control. It allows the user to select a number from a range. Spin controls have a text box for direct imput and display of the current number. Spin controls increment and decrement the current number. They can have shortcuts. In dialogs, the side-effect of a spin control may be immediate if there is a preview window but usually they are delayed until the dialog is closed. In toolbars, the effects are more immediate.</p>
  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>Each spin control is tested with its associated text box. Testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "spin control". Use <link uri="textbox.xml" type="module">Text Box Tests</link> to test the associated text box.</p>
<p>When side-effects are delayed, the "triggering" control must be used before a spin control value can influence it.</p>
  </context>
  <warning>
<p>There is no project specification for this control, however, it is described in the help system of many interface development products often as part of another control.</p>

   <p name="Principle">Visual inspection of the appearance and position of this control is to match the specification up to minor variations caused by the drawing tool or textual description of this control.</p>

   <p name="Notes">A label may be placed near the spin control, usually to its left or on top. An underscored letter indicates an &lt;Alt&gt;&lt;alpha&gt; shortcut.</p>

  <step name="1.1" link="Bug">Inspect the appearance of the spin control.
   <r>The spin control and label must have the styles, colors and sizes indicated in the specification.</r>
   <p name="bug">Spin control has incorrect appearance</p>
  </step>
  <step name="1.2" link="Bug">Inspect the locations of the spin control and label relative to eachother and other visible controls.
   <r>The spin control and label should be close to the positions indicated in the specification.</r>
   <p name="bug">Spin control has incorrect location</p>

   <p name="Principle">Spin controls have many uses and cause widely different side-effects.</p>

  <step name="3.1" link="Bug">Click the up arrow on the spin control.
   <r>
<ul>
	<li>The current number in the text box is incremented unless it was the highest value of the valid range.</li>

  <step name="3.5" link="Bug">When operating the spin control, do side-effects obscure or disable other functionality in the control frame or in an affected view?
