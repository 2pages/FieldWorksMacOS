  <introduction>
<p>A list box is an input control. It allows the user to select a text value from a list. List boxes are many times bundled with other controls to produce things like combo boxes for text input. Sometimes other controls set the list box selected value. List boxes can have shortcuts. In dialogs, the side-effect of a list box may be immediate if there is a preview window but usually they are delayed until the dialog is closed. In toolbars, the effects are more immediate. List boxes may be in an open rectangular frame or a drop-down frame.</p>
  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>Each list box is tested with its associated controls so that side-effects can be noted. Testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "list box" or the name of a control that triggers an unexpected side-effect that relies on the list box value to occur. Use <link uri="textbox.xml" type="module">Text Box Tests</link> to test the associated text box.</p>
<p>When side-effects are delayed, the "triggering" control must be used before a list box value can influence it.</p>
  </context>
  <warning>
<p>There is no project specification for this control, however, it is described in the help system of many interface development products often as part of another control.</p>
