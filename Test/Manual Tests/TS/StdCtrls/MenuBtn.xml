  <introduction>
<p>A menu button is a simple control which displays a menu list. Menu lists may change depending on text selections in open views. Clicking a menu item may bring up another menu list or perform an action like a button or toggle a state like a checkbox.</p>
  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>Each menu button may require the selection of text in a view, and selection of each of the items in its list to thoroughly test its action. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of such settings since most are independent. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If a step fails, the bug should be reported for that button or menu item. The first words of a bug report title for this button should be a noun phrase containing the name of the button or menu item.</p>
  </context>
  <warning>
<p>There is no project specification for this control, however, each button and menu item is described in a specification.</p>
