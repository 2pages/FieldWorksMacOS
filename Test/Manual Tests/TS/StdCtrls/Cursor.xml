  <introduction>
   <p>Most GUI <i>gestures</i> involve the cursor (i.e., pointer) and pressing its buttons. While interface objects that are activated using such gestures are tested in separate documents, this one documents tests that involve gestures and objects that have no functionality of themselves, such as text. They are <i>selectable</i> objects.</p>
<p>To select text, move the cursor to the start of the text you want to select. Hold down the left mouse button and drag across the text or down across lines of text. When you let the button up, highlighting indicates what text was selected. Selection is part of the copy and cut gestures.</p>
  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>Because of the structure of selectable objects, gestures like copying, cutting and pasting can be complex and have different results even depending on the order in which the operations are applied. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these gestures, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Cursor gesture".</p>
