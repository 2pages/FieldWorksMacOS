  <introduction>
<p>A text box is a text input control. It allows editing of the text, filtering, type-ahead, validation, cut, paste and deletion. Text boxes are many times bundled with other controls to produce things like combo boxes containing preset selection values. Sometimes other controls set the text box value. Text boxes can have shortcuts. In dialogs, the side-effect of a text box may be immediate if there is a preview window but usually they are delayed until the dialog is closed. In toolbars, the effects are more immediate.</p>
  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>Each text box is tested with its associated controls so that side-effects can be noted. Testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "text box" or the name of a control that triggers an unexpected side-effect that relies on the text box value to occur.</p>
<p>When side-effects are delayed, the "triggering" control must be used before a text box value can influence it.</p>
  </context>
  <warning>
<p>There is no project specification for this control, however, it is described in the help system of many interface development products often as part of another control.</p>
