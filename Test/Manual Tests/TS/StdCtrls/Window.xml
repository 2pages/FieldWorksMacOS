  <introduction>
<p>Most windows in a FieldWorks application have a few standard widgets and menus. The behavior of these widgets and menus is similar in each application window. Standard widgets include the minimize, maximize/restore and close (X) frame buttons. Standard menus include "File", "Window" and "Help".</p>
  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>Each widget and menu is tested separately. When possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the word "window" or the window's title.</p>
  </context>
  <warning>
<p>There is no project specification for windows in general, however, all FieldWorks windows have specifications.</p>
