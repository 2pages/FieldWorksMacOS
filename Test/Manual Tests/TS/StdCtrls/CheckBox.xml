  <introduction>
<p>A check box is a simple two state control. It may simply set up an internal interface or program state or it may have immediate side-effects. In dialogs, the side-effect of a check box is typically delayed until the dialog is closed.</p>
  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>Each check box may be tested alone. Testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "check box".</p>
<p>When side-effects are delayed, the "triggering" control must be used before the check box action can be witnessed.</p>
  </context>
  <warning>
<p>There is no project specification for this control, however, it is described in the help system of many interface development products.</p>
