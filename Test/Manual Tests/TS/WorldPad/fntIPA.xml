<p>Often times bugs in this font are isolated but may affect the placement or appearance of many characters in a view. Try to report the bug in its most elemental form.</p>

  <guidelines>
<p>There is no project specification for this font.</p>

   <p name="Principle">Visual inspection of the appearance and position of each character is important to insure all are displayable.</p>

  <step name="1.1" link="Bug">Click File-Open and browse for IPA_Table.wpx. Click OK. Inspect the appearance of each character against the chart. <link uri="ipachart.gif" type="doc">IPA chart to compare characters.</link>
   <r>Each character should match.</r>
   <p name="Notes">The IPA_Table.xml file should be in the same directory as this test file.</p>

  <title tag="fipaKey">IPA Keyboarding</title>
  <context>
<p>When WorldPad is running and the main view is empty</p>

   <p name="Principle">Every character must be keyboarded to prove it can be.</p>

  <step name="2.1" link="Bug">Use the <link uri="ipakeys1.gif" type="doc">IPA keyboarding codes</link> to enter all characters.
   <r>Each character should be displayed by the indicated code.</r>
   <p name="Notes">Keyman has to be set up and running to allow keyboarding using the codes.</p>

  <step name="2.2" link="Bug">Use the <link uri="ipakeys2.gif" type="doc">IPA keyboarding codes</link> to enter all diacritics.
   <r>Each diacritic should be displayed by the indicated code.</r>
   <p name="bug">IPA diacritic &lt;code&gt; does not key character</p>
  </step>
  <step name="2.3" link="Bug">Use a <link uri="czech1.gif" type="doc">Czech IPA paragraph</link> to test the use of the IPA font. Type the paragraph using the keyman codes from the previous steps.
   <r>It should be possible to type fluidly without a lot of difficult associations or odd finger reaching. It may take a little getting used to.</r>
   <p name="bug">IPA &lt;code&gt; is not easy to use entering a string of text</p>
