  <introduction>
   <p>File-New creates a new World Pad window with the selected file in it.</p>
   <p>File-Close shuts the current window and makes sure your file is saved. If there are no more WorldPad windows open, it opens a new window with nothing in it.</p>
  </introduction>

  <context>
<p>If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "File New" or "File-Close".</p>
