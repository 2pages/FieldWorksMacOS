<introduction>
<p>The Writing System Properties dialog shows the properties of a Writing System. It is accessed through the Modify... button on the Writing System tab of the Project Properties dialog (see <link uri="http://lsdev.sil.org/intranet/FwSpecs/FW/Expl/Dialogs/Properties/LangProjProperties.html" type="doc">Language Project Properties -- Writing System</link> and <link uri="FilePropsProj.xml">File - Project Properties Tests</link>). Through this dialog the user can modify different settings for the writing system such as font and language.

<p>Many setting combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Writing System Properties"</p>
