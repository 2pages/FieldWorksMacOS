  <introduction>
   <p>The edit menu provides an alternate way to cut copy and paste selected text. To completely test this functionality test the <link uri="../StdCtrls/Cursor.xml" type="module">shortcut keys</link> to achieve the same functions. Some of the steps in the standard controls cut, copy and paste test are the same as in this one but the bugs are different.</p>
<p>To select text, move the cursor to the start of the text you want to select. Hold down the left mouse button and drag across the text or down across lines of text. When you let the button up, highlighting indicates what text was selected. Selection is part of the copy and cut functions.</p>
  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>Because of the structure of selectable objects, functions like copying, cutting and pasting can be complex and have different results even depending on the order in which the operations are applied. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these gestures, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Edit-(command)".</p>

</i> table: "Atomic Ref" refers to single-reference fields like single tags, and enums like Confidence. "Sequence Ref" ["Atomic Seq" is a typo] refers to multiple-reference fields, such as OCM tags. "All others" would include Date and integer fields.</p>
