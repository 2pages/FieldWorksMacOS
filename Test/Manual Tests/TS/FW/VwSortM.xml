  <introduction>
   <p>This menu item brings up a cascading submenu whose primary purpose is allow the user to select which Sort Method the data is presented in. Individual applications will define these sort methods, and users will be able to customize and add their own.</p>
   <p>For an overview, see discussion at the <link uri="http://lsdev.sil.org/intranet/FwSpecs/FW/App/Commands/ToolsMenu/Options/Sort/Sort.html" type="doc">Sorting spec</link>. The layout of the View-Sort Methods menu is shown there.</p>
   <p name="todo">Not all of the Sorting spec details are yet reflected in this test, e.g., the progress bar and ability to cancel building the sort index. These are not included in version 1.</p>
   <p>(Dynamic menu simply means that the contents of the menu change to reflect the current state of the program, e.g. as more sort methods are added to the Tools Options Sort Methods tab, those new sort methods should also appear in the View bar and in the View-Sort Methods cascading menu (making this menu a dynamic one).</p>
  </introduction>
<context>
<p>Many setting combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "View-Sort Methods"</p>
