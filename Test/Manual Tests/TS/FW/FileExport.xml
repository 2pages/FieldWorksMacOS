<introduction>
<p>The Export dialog is called in response to the File-Export command. Its purpose is to identify the name of the file to export, and the way to perform the export operation. It is implemented on Generic Application, but is highly customizable by the individual application. The Data Notebook can be exported based on the current view (Browse view is currently not supported). The Topics List Editor works similiarly.  Most applications will support several formats to export in including WorldPad (.wpx), Rich Text Format (.rtf), and others.</p>

<p>Many setting combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "File - Export"</p>
