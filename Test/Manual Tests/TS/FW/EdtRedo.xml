<introduction>
<p>Reverses the most recent Undo action. That is, if something was undone, then this menu item does it back again. The menu item adjusts to reflect the nature of the action that is to be redone, e.g., "Redo Typing." The item is disabled if there is nothing to redo (e.g., if nothing has been undone, or if some other action has happened since the last undo command.) The Redo menu item actually represents a stack (a sequence of actions). If you do an Undo operation three times, then there will be three things on the Redo stack. Of course, as soon as you do a new action (as opposed to an Undo), then the stack is cleared and Redo is disabled.</p>

<p>When performing Redo, check to see if Redo needs to be selected more than once to perform a Redo operation. Also, check for any unusual cursor. Check if Redo will redo changes to a record that is no longer visible. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Edit-Redo"</p>
