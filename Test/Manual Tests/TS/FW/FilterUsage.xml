<introduction>
<p>Using Filters under various conditions in Fieldworks applications.

<p name="todo">Think of more test cases for filter usage.</p>

</introduction>

<context>
<p>Many setting combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Filter Usage"</p>

<context>
<p>When the application is running</p>
</context>
<step name="0.1" link="Bug">
 Create a basic filter for an existing field and entry type (can be done under Tools-Options-Filters). Set up a condition that will yield several matches. Apply the filter using the buttons on the side bar or the commands under View-Filters menu.
 <r>
<ul>
<li>The filter makes "visible" only the entries that match the criteria defined by the filter.</li>
	<li>The yellow filtered light and the number of filtered entries should appear in the status bar</li>
 </ul>
</r>
<p name="bug">
</p>
</step>

<step name="0.2" link="Bug">
  Turn off the filter using the "No Filter" filter.
  <r>All the entries are displayed normally by the default settings and the status bar displays the total number of entries and has removed the yellow filtered light.</r>
  <p name="bug">
</p>
</step>

<step name="0.3" link="Bug">
 Experiment with using the filter in different views (Document, Browse, Data Entry, etc.) that are available.
 <r>The filter should be available from all views and the particular filter should display the same entries in all views.</r>
 <p name="bug">
</p>
</step>

<step name="0.4" link="Bug">
 Create an advanced filter. Apply it to the current view.
 <r>The view should be filtered based on the settings of the advanced filter.</r>
 <p name="bug">
</p>
</step>

<step name="0.5" link="Bug">
 Try applying a second filter to test layered filtering.
 <r>The second filter should be And'ed with the first selected so the entries "visible" are a combination of the two filters</r>
 <p name="bug">
</p>
 <p name="note">Not implemented for version 1</p>
</step>

<step name="0.6" link="Bug">
 Try several other fields and conditions with filters. Try to exercise the different types (text, lists, links, etc). Apply the filter and verify.
 <r>The filter should only display the entries that match the criteria.</r>
 <p name="bug">
</p>
</step>

</case>

<case id="filtuseOvl" num="1" order="any">
<title tag="filtuseOvl">Filters with Overlays</title>
<context>
<p>When the application is running</p>
</context>
<p name="note">Overlays are only available in Data Notebook</p>

<step name="1.1" link="Bug">
Create a basic filter using an overlay (create an overlay if none exist) as the field criteria. Choose a list item and condition that should return some matches. This can be done under Tools-Options-Filters.
<r>A filter is created that can be used to filter entries based on the selected overlay.</r>
<p name="bug">
</p>
</step>


<step name="1.2" link="Bug">
Apply the newly created filter.
<r>The view should be filtered based on the condition and item for the selected overlay.</r>
<p name="bug">
</p>
</step>

<step name="1.3" link="Bug">
Try creating an advanced filter using overlays. Apply it to the current view.
<r>The view should filter correctly based on the settings for the advanced filter.</r>
<p name="bug">
</p>
</step>

<step name="1.4" link="Bug">
Exercise the filter by turning it on and off under different views. Switch from one view to another while the filter is on.
<r>
<ul>
<li>The filter should work in all views.</li>
   <li>The cursor should stay in the same entry (position if possible) when switching from view to view.</li>
</ul>
</r>
