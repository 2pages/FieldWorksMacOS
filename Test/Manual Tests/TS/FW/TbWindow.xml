  <introduction>
   <p>Window toolbar icons include those for opening a new window on the current view, splitting/unsplitting the curent window, cascading and tiling windows.</p>
  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>Most icons are tested separately. None on this toolbar perform inverse operations, but splitting is a toggle. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Window Toolbar".</p>
