<introduction>
<p>Selects as much as is appropriate for the given view. In the initial implementation this to corresponds to what can be cut or copied to the clipboard and will thus be limited to the string or text where the cursor is located.</p>
<p>Later, this may be extended to non-editable selections, so that data can be copied from a FieldWorks application to other apps. In this case, Select All behaves as follows: If in data entry view, then this selects the data in the current field. If in a record-oriented view, then the entire record is selected. If it is a document view (e.g., a view of the entire object), then everything in the view is displayed.</p>

<p>Many selection combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Edit-Select All"</p>
