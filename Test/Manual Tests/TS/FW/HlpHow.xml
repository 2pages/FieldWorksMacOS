<introduction>
<p>This menu item brings up a help topic which lists the tasks that can be done with the application (e.g., the Research Notebook Editor) This is actually a hierarchy of tasks, from generic to specific tasks. These help modules primarily talk about how to perform the task using the application; they have links to more generically written modules that talk about the theory behind the task in non-computer terms. By browsing through this topic, the user can get an overview of the major uses of the application, and hopefully get started quickly in using it in a meaningful manner.</p>

<p>The goal for testing this help is to check the correctness, consistency and structure of the help file. Though the step may apply to all members of one kind or another, it is not always possible to test each one. Do so randomly if all can not be done as time and probability permit. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Help-How".</p>
