<introduction>
<p>Repeats the find operation as specified by the most recent search, which may have been via the Find Tab on the Find and Replace dialog or by the Quick Find toolbar command. The search begins at the current text cursor position, and moves forward through the data. If the Find Dialog is currently not displayed, the Next Match operation still works according to the last specified search; but without displaying the dialog.</p>

<p>Many setting combinations are possible in connection with the Edit-Find dialog. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Edit-Next Match"</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is a Quick Find combo box on a visible toolbar, it is updated, if necessary, to display the current search text from the Edit-Find dialog</li>
<li>The main window status bar shows the progress, e.g., "Searching entry 45 of 3540..." until a match is found or there is nothing left to search</li>
<li>If the search hasn't started, the first instance after the original cursor position, even in a writing system different from the search text, that has matching underlying text is highlighted</li>
<li>The main window changes/scrolls to show the first matched text after the original cursor position</li>
<li>If there is no match, nothing is highlighted and a window displays indicating no matching text was found.</li>

Results for different views:
<ul>
 <li>In browse view, if match found inside a partially visible field with the match not visible, the cursor is placed at the beginning of the field with the match (or the nearest field in that entry that the cursor can be placed in).</li>
 <li>In document or browse view and in a non-editable field, selection is still drawn on the matching text. However, text still cannot be edited.</li>
 <li>Switching views after a match has been found should retain the cursor location.</li>
 <li>If find is set to look in a particular field and the current view does not have that field showing, the user is notified and  given the opportunity to Cancel or Modify the find, or change the view and continue. (Not in v1)</li>
</ul>
