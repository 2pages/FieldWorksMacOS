  <introduction>
   <p>The View-Views menu item brings up a list of the views defined in the application, for which the data can be displayed. This will typically include a data entry view, a browse view, and various other types of views, depending on the data. Individual applications will define these views, and users will be able to customize and add their own (e.g., an application may ship with one Data Entry view set to see all fields, and the user elect to may define a new Data Entry view that just shows a subset of fields.)</p>
   <p>For an overview, see discussion at <link uri="http://lsdev.sil.org/intranet/FwSpecs/FW/App/Commands/ViewMenu/ViewMenu.html#View-ListOfViews" type="module">FW View-Views</link>
</p>
   <p>(Dynamic menu simply means that the contents of the menu change to reflect the current state of the program, e.g. as more views are added to the Tools Options View tab, those new views should also appear in the View bar and in the View-Views cascading menu (making this menu a dynamic one).</p>
