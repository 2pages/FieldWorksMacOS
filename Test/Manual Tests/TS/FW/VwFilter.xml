  <introduction>
   <p>The View-Filters menu item brings up a cascading submenu whose primary purpose is to allow the user to select which filter the user wants to use to see the data presented in. The submenu contains a list of the filters defined in the application, for which the data can be displayed. Individual applications will define these filters, and users will be able to customize and add their own filters.</p>
   <p>For an overview, see discussion at <link uri="http://lsdev.sil.org/intranet/FwSpecs/FW/App/Commands/VIEWMENU/VIEWMENU.HTML#View-Filters" type="doc">Views-Filters</link>. For more detail, see discussion near the bottom of the <link uri="http://lsdev.sil.org/intranet/FwSpecs/FW/App/Commands/ToolsMenu/Options/Filters/Filters.html" type="doc">Filters spec</link>.</p>
   <p>Try these steps in any appropriate order. Try them with different combinations of the Status Bar and View Bar being enabled or disabled.</p>
   <p>The Browse View is probably the easiest way to check whether a filter is excluding the correct records; but also test the Document and Data Entry views.</p>
   <p>(Dynamic menu simply means that the contents of the menu change to reflect the current state of the program, e.g. as more filters are added to the Tools Options filters tab, those new filters should also appear in the View bar and in the View-Filters cascading menu (making this menu a dynamic one).</p>

   Under the View menu select the Filters item. Compare the list that pops up with the Filters tab of the View Bar to the left side of the window.

	<li>The filter that is checked is the same as the filter button that is depressed on the View Bar.</li>
</ul>

   <p name="Note">*Eventually, according to the spec, it will be possible to have more than one filter active at a time (a.k.a. layering filters). In that case, it must also be possible to uncheck one filter, leaving others active.</p>
