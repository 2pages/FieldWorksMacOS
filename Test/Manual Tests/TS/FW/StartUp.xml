<introduction>
<p>The Data Notebook and Topics List Editor need atleast one entry to display in the main window when the application loads. The following tests cover the special cases when there are no entries in a language project or topics list. A special dialog should be displayed in either case to ask the user what he/she would like to do. There is also a special dialog displayed when Data Notebook is started for the first time (and until the user tells the dialog to go away).</p>

<context>
<p>Relatively few setting combinations are possible. Even so, testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the word "Start Up".</p>

After installing the application, double click on the icon to load it. View the state of the application on initial start up.
<r>The application should load with the Welcome dialog described in <link uri="http://lsdev.sil.org/intranet/FwSpecs/FW/App/Features/GeneralUI/EmptyPane/EmptyPane.htm" type="doc">the specifications</link>.</r>

<step name="1.2" link="Bug">
Visually inspect the Welcome dialog.

<r>
<ul>
<li>Start - simply closes the dialog and drops the user into the current record.</li>
<li>Tutorials - closes the dialog and launches the tutorials</li>
