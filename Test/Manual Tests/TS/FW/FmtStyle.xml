  <introduction>
   <p>The Format Style dialog allows the user to change the style characteristics of selected fields.</p>
  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>Many style setting combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Format Style".</p>
