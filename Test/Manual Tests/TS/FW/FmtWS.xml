<introduction>
<p>Permits the writing system to be changed for selected text. If no text is selected, then the current mode of the text cursor is set to that writing system, and any new text typed will be in that writing system. When the writing system for selected text is changed, the underlying characters are interpreted by that new writing system. The software cannot guarantee that the interpretation will be correct, as the user is expected to change writing systems responsibly. The rendering mechanism is expected to handle characters that are not defined in the writing system (e.g., by displaying squares.)</p>

<p>Many setting combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Format-Writing system"</p>
