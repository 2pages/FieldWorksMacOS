<introduction>
<p>Inserts a graphic at the current text cursor position. This graphic may be in any of several formats supported by the system (BMP, GIF, JPEG). The menu item brings up a dialog by which the user can browse for the desired file (including seeing a preview). The behavior of the Insert Picture command is currently not implemented as we'd like. This needs further work.</p>

<p>Many insertion combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Insert-Picture"</p>
