<introduction>
<p>Drag and drop gesturing provides many intuitive operations including openning and replacing content and linking. Embedded links in structured text fields that reference other entries, subentries, fields, structured paragraphs or selected text. Cross-reference links are the kind of links found in cross-reference fields (e.g., in the Data Notebook Analysis entry, cross-reference fields are the Supporting Evidence and Counter Evidence fields; in the lexicon, cross-references are used extensively for linking one lexeme with another, as in synonyms, antonyms, lexical functions, etc.)</p>

<p>Many combinations of sources and targets are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Drag and Drop"</p>
