<introduction>
<p>Data Notebook and the Topics List Editor are two different applications that will likely be running at the same time, working together.  It is important that the information these two applications have in common remains in synchronization between them in order to avoid user confusion and preserve data integrity. This script tests to make sure the overlapping areas of these two applications keeps the information the same in both applications.</p>
<p>No Current Specs, See Raid reports 2203 and 1901</p>
<p name="todo">Think of any additional synchronization concerns</p>
</introduction>
<context>
<p>Many setting combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the word "Synchronization".</p>
