  <introduction>
  <p>Specs for these tests are based on the following link: <link uri="http://lsdev.sil.org/intranet/FwSpecs/FW/App/Commands/FileMenu/FileMenu.html#File-Exit" type="module">File: Exit</link>.</p>
  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>These tests may be run with the application in any state. They will normally be run after most other testing has been completed since the application will likely be terminated. Many side-effects are possible, like leaky memory, but for the time being, only the first-order effects are tested for.</p>
