  <introduction>
   <p>The Window Menu allows the user to manipulate the number and layout of application windows.</p>
  </introduction>

  <context>
<p>The window layouts are exclusive, but they can be tested with split windows inside. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Window Menu".</p>

that would make it extend off the screen, in which case it is shrunk to fit
the screen.  If that would make it too small (smaller than 400x400 pixels),
the new window appears at the top-left of the screen.</r>

<ul>
<li>The windows are arranged with the first one in the top-left corner,</li>
<li>The windows move down approximately 20 pixels, and to the right the same number of pixels, so the title bar of each window is visible.</li>
<li>The windows are all the same size, about two-thirds of the monitor's viewport.</li>
<li>The window which was topmost (i.e., the one from which the Cascade command was issued) is the topmost and active after the cascade is complete. (That is, it is the final window to be arranged on the screen.)</li>
</ul>

If many windows are being cascaded so that the bottom of a window reaches the bottom of the viewport, then cascading resumes at the top-left corner again. If only one window is open, it is simply resized and moved to the top-left, in accordance with the above.</r>
