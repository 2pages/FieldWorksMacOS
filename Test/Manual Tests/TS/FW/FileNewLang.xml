<introduction>
<p>The New Language Definition Wizard is used to create a new Language Definition. It is accessed through the New...button on the Writing System tab of the Project Properties dialog (see <link uri="http://lsdev.sil.org/intranet/FwSpecs/FW/Expl/Dialogs/Properties/LangProjProperties.html" type="doc">Language Project Properties -- Writing System</link> and <link uri="FileProperties.xml">File - Language Project Properties Tests</link>). The Wizard has two steps and so two dialog boxes.

<p>Many setting combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "File - New Language Definition"</p>

<p>When language project "A" is open (e.g. TestLangProj),
do the following in sequential order:</p>
</context>

<step name="3.1">
Create a new writing system, using File - Properties - Project Properties -
Writing Systems - Add - New, and step through the wizard.  Press Finish.
<r>The new writing system appears in the list for Vernacular or
Analysis writing systems, depending on which Add button you pressed,
and is checked.</r>
</step>

<step name="3.1.1">
Press OK on the Project Properties dialog.  Then open it again
and go to the Writing Systems page.
<r>The new writing system is still there in the list for Vernacular or
Analysis writing systems.</r>
</step>

<step name="3.1.2">
Press OK on the Project Properties dialog.  Go to a multilingual
field.  (I think you may have to be go to TLE to see this?  Ask
an analyst.)
<r>The new writing system abbreviation appears in blue at the left
of the appropriate fields, aligned
vertically with other writing systems in the same category (e.g.
ENG, FRN). (This apparently only occurs for Analysis writing systems.
Are there other fields where multiple vernacular WS's are used?)</r>
</step>

<step name="3.2">
Open language project "B" (e.g. Lela-Teli Sample).
Then close project A, then close project B.
Open language project A.  Check the list of writing systems under
File - Properties - Project Properties - Writing Systems.
<r>The writing system added in 3.1 appears in the list for Vernacular or
Analysis writing systems.</r>
</step>

<step name="3.2.1">
Then open language project B.
Check the list of writing systems under
File - Properties - Project Properties - Writing Systems.
<r>The writing system added in 3.1 does NOT appear in the list
for Vernacular or Analysis writing systems.</r>
</step>

<step name="3.2.2">
Then go to a multilingual field (e.g. in TLE -- see step 3.1.2).
<r>The new writing system abbreviation does NOT appear in the blue list
at the left of the multilingual fields.</r>
</step>
