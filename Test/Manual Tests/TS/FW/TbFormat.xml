  </introduction>
  <context>
<p>Most icons are tested separately. A few that perform inverse operations like in and out-dent are best tested together. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Format Toolbar".</p>
<p>For more detailed tests of functionality, use the respective tests available in other test scripts.</p>
