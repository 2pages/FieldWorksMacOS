<introduction>
<p>Launches a dialog box to tell about the application, especially its version number and date. Although implemented on the Generic Application, the dialog is configured by the individual application in order to show its name and its version number. The dialog also shows available memory and disk space, items which are important to some users in gauging how to best use the program.</p>

<step name="1.1" link="Bug">Invoke Help-About (AppName). <link uri="http://lsdev.sil.org/intranet/FwSpecs/FW/App/Commands/HELPMENU/HELPMENU.HTML#Help-About" type="doc">Help-About (AppName) specification</link> to visually inspect the dialog layout.
   <r>Up to approximate size and position the two should be the same - especially any text and icons.</r>
<p name="bug">Help-About (AppName) layout incorrect</p>
</step>
<step name="1.2">Use <link uri="../StdCtrls/Dialog.xml" type="module">Basic Dialog Tests</link> to test this dialog's basic functionality.
   <r>Report any failures as suggested using "Help-About (AppName)" as the name of the dialog.</r>
</step>

<step name="1.3" link="Bug">Check the displayed application name.
<r>The appropriate app name is displayed, preceded by "SIL FieldWorks" (to
avoid possible trademark conflicts).</r>
<p name="bug">Help-About (AppName) app name incorrect</p>
</step>

<step name="1.4" link="Bug">Check the displayed version number.
   <r>The version number is of the form "V, M, yyyy, mmddb (B version)"
where V is the version, M is the milestone, yyyy is the year, mmdd is the date
of the build, and b is the build (0 for nightly build, 1..8 for subsequent
builds, 9 for individual developer's build). B is "release" or
"debug" depending on which version was installed (should always be "release"
for external users).</r>
<p name="bug">Help-About (AppName) version incorrect</p>
</step>

<step name="1.5" link="Bug">Check the displayed copyright date.
   <r>The copyright date shows a range of years from the year this application
began to be developed, to the year of this version's release.</r>
<p name="bug">Help-About (AppName) copyright date incorrect</p>
</step>

<step name="1.6" link="Bug">While About box is open, attempt to interact
with the application, e.g. try to open another About box.
   <r>The About box is modal, so the application cannot be accessed until the
About box is closed.  There can only be one About box open at a time.</r>
<p name="bug">Help-About (AppName) dialog non-modal</p>
