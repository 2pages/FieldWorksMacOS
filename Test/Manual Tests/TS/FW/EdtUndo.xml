<introduction>
<p>Undoes the most recent action. The menu item adjusts to reflect the nature of the action that is to be undone, e.g., "Undo Typing", "Undo Paste", or "Undo Replace All". It is possible to undo changes all the way back to the most recent commitment of a transaction. If an action cannot be undone (and there are very few of these), then the dialog to the right is displayed to give appropriate warning. You can elect to go ahead with the action, or to cancel and back out of the action. When an undoable action is performed, it clears out the undo stack on the menu. The Undo menu item is disabled if there is nothing to undo.</p>

<context>
<p>When performing Undo, check to see if Undo needs to be selected more than once to perform an Undo operation. Also, check for any unusual cursor. Check if Undo will undo changes to a record that is no longer visible. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Edit-Undo"</p>
