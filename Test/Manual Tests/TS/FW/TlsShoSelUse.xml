<introduction>
<p>Brings up a cascading sub-menu showing possible applications that can be launched according to the current context. Applications such as the Lexical Database Editor or the Text Editor are displayed if the current selection is on an object that is readily editable by such an application. If the user selects an application from this submenu, then that application is launched (or brought to the top if it is already running) and positioned to display the selected object. The menu item is grayed out if there is not context defined, or if there is no application available from the selected context. A selection, at its topmost level, will be either a single object or a sequence of objects. (There may well be many objects embedded or referenced within it, but we are interested only in the top-level objects.) Thus it is for these objects that the cascading menu will show the available tools. Thus a menu item might be "Major Entry Editor on abdul", or "Possibilities List editor for Locations". As the latter example points out, for some objects we will be interested in the containing object; e.g., for a Possibilities List Item we are going to want to display the tools for the Possibilities List itself.</p>

<context>
<p>Many setting combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "Tools-Show Selection Using"</p>
