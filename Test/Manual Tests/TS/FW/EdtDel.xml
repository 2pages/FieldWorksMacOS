  <introduction>
<p>Brings up a dialog, which is used to clarify the item that the user wants to delete. It presents all of the possible items that might be deleted according to the current context, and allows the user to make the choice as to which item to delete.</p>
<p>The basic functionality of the Edit menu is tested via the <link uri="../StdCtrls/MenuBtn.xml">Menu button tests</link>. That includes this menu item. This separate test exists to test the more complex behavior of this menu item.</p>
