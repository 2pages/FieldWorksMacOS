<introduction>
<p>The Project Properties Dialog shows the properties for the current language project. Under the <i>General</i> tab are  included the name, dates created and modified, etc. The Name can be modified through this dialog; the other items are informational. Under the <i>Writing Systems</i> tab, the user can configure the display of applications within the language project. The user can decide which languages are part of a project, which ones to display right now, and the order in which to display them. Under the <i>External Links</i> tab, the user can set up a reference folder to be used with external links the project may be using.

<p>Many setting combinations are possible. Testing does not require exhaustive combinations of these settings, but should identify critical ones and seek reasonable coverage for others. If possible, testing continues after a bug is found to report as many symptoms as reasonable. If these tests fail on more than one step, combine the suggested bugs into a single bug report only if the underlying cause seems to be the same. The first words of the bug report title should be a noun phrase containing the words "File - Project Properties"</p>
<p name="todo">Add tests to make sure the OK and Cancel button
preserve / don't preserve the effects of the Add, Add - New, Delete,
and Modify buttons on the WS tab; and also changes on the other tabs.
Unless you think this is adequately covered by "Exercise Dialog
Controls."</p>
<p name="todo">Also make sure when you check/uncheck and/or add/delete
writing systems and press OK, the appropriate change takes place
in multilingual fields: the set of blue WS abbreviations on the left
changes accordingly.
