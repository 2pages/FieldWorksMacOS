------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RandyR, 4 Nov 2008. 1) Remove previous comments, and get this file ready for use in the WW branch.
RandyR, 4 June 2009. 1) Add two attribute classes for model defined classes and properties,
	2) Switch XML BEP to use more LINQ.XML.
RandyR, 4 June 2009. Test bug fix related to persisting/reloading ScrRefSystem in the regular
	BEP persisting tests, rather than in a separate set of tests. Using the regular BEP
	tests allows for keeping the ToXML and Load methods private, rather than internal.
RandyR, 5 June 2009. Finish adding support for using model-defined class and property custom attributes.
RandyR, 7 June 2009. Integration: Trunk->WW.
RandyR, 8 June 2009. Omit empty XML elements, and remove some un-needed placeholder XML elements.

	2. Remove bogus 'UserViews' property from LangProject.
RandyR, 9 June 2009. Add new attribute to XML that tells if the surrogate is for an owning or refence object
	(as per Neil Mayhew's request).

RandyR, 19 June 2009. 1) Add support for porting from an open BEP  to a new BEP (disabled),
	2) Add C# impl for writing system factory, since C++ version is singleton with no SqlServer.
RandyR, 19 June 2009. Clean out some methods on FdoCache, in favor of using Repositories.
RandyR, 19 June 2009. Make the C++ WritingSystemFactory not be a singleton, sans SqlServer DB connection.
RandyR, 20 June 2009. 1. Upgrade DB4o to v. 7.10.96.13184 (5 May 2009).
	2) Clean up some unused code.
RandyR, 23 June 2009. Introduce new 'FooTags' classes that handle constants from domain implementation classes.
RandyR, 24 June 2009. 1) Add generated partial methods, as per "Events" design.
	2) Updated some code to use the partial methods (Hand-written FDO overrides will mostly be replaced by using hem.)
RandyR, 24 June 2009. Update more code to use the partial methods.
RandyR, 25 June 2009. Implement FWR-5 (side effects for multi- string/unicode).
RandyR, 25 June 2009. Implement FWR-6 & part of FWR-3.

RandyR, 29 June 2009. Partial implementation of FWR-10: "Remove use of CmObject implementation class constants." The old constants are still being generated, but nothing uses them in the subset of assemblies that are being compiled.
RandyR, 30 June 2009. Integration: Trunk->WW.

RandyR, 9 July 2009. More PropChanged support (strings, TsStrings, Multi-alts, and almost all vector operations).
RandyR, 10 July 2009. Add another test related to Vector prop PropChange broadcasts.
RandyR, 10 July 2009. Add workaround hack to the StringUtils.GetString method (the one that returns the ITsString) to turn street-legal NFC xml to improper NFD xml, to get around the C++ bug in TsStreamWrapper or TsStrFactory.
RandyR, 13 July 2009. First part of FWR-27: "(De)Serialize custom properties in the data store." This part handles storing the property declarations in all the BEPS.
RandyR, 14 July 2009. Underpinnings of FWR-29: "Access custom properties via SDA". (Handles basic type properties, but not multistrs or MultiUnicode.)
RandyR, 16 July 2009. 1) More work on FWR-29: "Access custom properties via SDA". Adds support for ITsString and MultiUnicode (and thus MultuiString) properties. This support includes SDA read/write access, Undo/Redo, and PropChanged notifications. All of the current custom properties supported by Flex are now supported (not yet (de)serialized, as that is another JIRA issue). Remaining work on FWR-29 is the two custom object props for DN. 2) Updates to FDO doc.
RandyR, 17 July 2009. More work on FWR-29: "Access custom properties via SDA". Add support for atomic reference properties.

	Implement most of the remaining issues along the lines JohnT laid out.
	2) Implement most of FWR-27 "(De)Serialize custom properties in the data store." I think it all works,
	but I can't test some data types, since SDA supoprt is not complete yet.
RandyR, 20 July 2009. 1) Fixed custom prop reading bug in XML BEP. 2) Update FDO doc.
RandyR, 20 July 2009. Remove some old experimental stage Flex configuration files.
JohnT, 21 July 2009. Started trying to get some real views up, putting some things back into main.xml and commenting them out of
	the xml files it includes. A couple of code changes. It's to the point where we have a sidebar with Lexical Tools and Lexicon edit
	(and Lexicon Edit WANTPORT, which is the original but currently crashing version of this tool). The lexical edit tool has
	supposedly been cut down to just the main data entry pane (with no menus), but nothing actually shows up.
JohnT, 21 July 2009. Got minimal data entry view working.
RandyR, 21 July 2009. Get the following meu items working for Flex (and related toolbar btns, where there were toolbar btns).
	File-Open (el cheapo dlg), File-Save, File-Close, File-Exit, and Views-Refresh (F5).
JohnT, 21 July 2009. Simple views-based text editing (no multi-paragraph) is working.
RandyR, 21 July 2009. 1) Reinstate the C++ unit tests for mkGenLib, mkfwk, mkdba, mkcel, mklg, and mkvw,
	so they are run during a remakefw. 2) Remove some obsolete 'clutter' from the tests of mkdba, mkcel, and mkvw, so they pass.
RandyR, 22 July 2009. The C++ project files got left out of 26869.

RandyR, 27 July 2009. Refactor some generated FDO code.
JohnT, 28 July 2009. Implemented DomainDataByFlid.MakeNewObject.
	(some C++ tests fail on my computer, but I'm pretty sure it's not related to this checkin, which only changes FDO C# files).
SteveMiller, 29 July 2009. FWR-50: Write up installation instructions for Firebird.
RandyR, 29 July 2009. Add dire warning about one of the Firebird install options on Vista.
JohnT, 29 July 2009. Added some information on build and test problems to the getting started document. Also preliminary notes on Firebird.
SteveMiller, 29 July 2009. FWR-54: Change Firebird client/server password. Use the UTF8 character
	set with Firebird. Some comment clean up.

SteveMc, July 30, 2009.  Fixed FWR-56 "Remakefw creates ww\output\debug\debugprocs.dll, and then
	fails".
RandyR, 30 July 2009. More refactoring of BEP porting tests.
JohnT, 31 July 2009. Added new guide "New skills for a new architecture.htm".

		interface, CmObject.kClassId, and everything related.
	Added LexEdDll to the build and got it to compile.
	Removed the C++ metadatacache and tests.
	Removed Views virtual property tests (obsolete, and dependent on C++ MDC).
	Added FdoServiceLocator interface and made various methods, including new
		ICmObject.Services, return it instead of IServiceLocator. Put a few methods in
		it.
	Implemented a new static UndoableUnitOfWorkHelper.Do() method which handles rollback
		automatically iff an Exception is thrown.
	(later) Updated New FDO and Co. htm with a history of the kinds of changes I needed to
		make to get LexEdDll to work.
RandyR, 6 August 2009. 1) FWR-9 "Change public constructors on CmObjects to internal to
		'encourage' the use of Factories."
	2) FWR-10 "Remove use of CmObject implementation class constants."
RandyR, 6 August 2009. 1) Update the FDO doc. (Re-added the docx version as the live copy. The
		HTM version will also be saved in P4)
	2) More refactoring for BEP unit tests.

		Include displaying senses, gloss, and defn in DE view.
	Implemented LexSenseOutline as a full virtual property (with automatic PropChanged
		notification of affected senses when owning seqs change).
	Changed notification of object sequence changes to use new AddObjectEventArgs and
		RemoveObjectEventArgs, which indicate the position for
		sequence changes.
	Renamed RemoveQuietly to RemoveOwnee; no longer entirely quiet, because there is a
		remove notification the old owner receives. An argument of RemoveObjectEventArgs
		allows determining whether the object is being moved or deleted.
	Fixed setting an atomic property to send RemoveOwnee notification if old object is not
		null.
	Fixed vector Clear() operator to not mark object dirty if it was already empty.
	Fixed PropChanged notification to not send notifications for deleted objects.
	Added a constructor to Attribute to allow not specifying signature when it is irrelevant;
		changed existing cases to use it where appropriate.
	Fixed vector tests to not complain of additional PropChanged notifications not expected
		(e.g., from side effects like LexSenseOutline changes).
	Made vector PropChanged messages able to recognize a smaller change when there is a
		common unchanged sequence at the end of the old and new values.
RandyR, 7 August 2009. Next round of FDO namespace reoganization.
	(Includes FWR-57 "Move hand-written and generated Repository implementation code to
		FDO.Infrastructure namespace")
RandyR, 7 August 2009. Next round of FDO namespace reoganization: Make more classes internal.
RandyR, 7 August 2009. Last round (I hope) of FDO namespace reoganization: Move more files into
	FDO.Infrastructure.Impl.
RandyR, 7 August 2009. Did a couple 'todos' in the code, so PropChanged calls are broadcast on
	Undo and Redo.
RandyR, 8 August 2009. Rename one more namespace.
RandyR, 8 August 2009. Round 2 of the rename.
TimS, August 10, 2009. Build fix (Generated FDO code was missing a reference to
	SIL.FieldWorks.FDO.Infrastructure.Impl)

RandyR, 11 August 2009. Implemented FWR-16: "Support ITsTextProps in the internal xml read/write
	generated code."

	weird crashes later since it was deleted before the RCW was garbage-collected.
TimS, August 12, 2009. FWR-76, FWR-77 Move classes in OverridesScripture.cs that don't belong in
		FDO.
	Get the TeStylesXml project to build.

	with filter/sort capabilities.
DamienD, 13 Aug 2009. Fixed initial set of slices in the Lexicon Edit data tree.
JohnT, 13 Aug 2009. Restored full 3-pane main data entry view. Implemented virtual properties

	LexEntry.PicturesOfSenses.
	Enhanced support for virtual properties so implementing property can return
	IEnumerable<T> where T: ICmObject, so now by preference virtual property methods should
	return some kind of collection of the appropriate class of object.
RandyR, 13 August 2009. Do more on FWR-35: "Remove obsolete code from the build and from P4".
	1) Remove remainder of DbAccess (move MDC interface to kernel.)
	2) Remove some other obsolete SQL stuff form the views code.

JohnT, 24 Sep 2012. Integrated changes from 7.2. Made a new build tool to replace the (recently became flaky) gawk script used in building C++ tests.
	Note that the nant build is broken, even before this change: the script generated for MigrateSql is broken, has target init-Debug twice.
	The MSBuild (ww\build directory, build /t:remakefw) succeeds, but some unit tests fail (also even before this change).
	The xWorks ones pass when retried, I think we're missing a dependency.
	Others pass when Output/X/ScrChecks.dll/pdb is copied to Distfiles/Editorial Checks and Utilities.dll is copied from Distfiles to Output/Debug.
	I will work on solving these problems, but I think the evidence is pretty good that the integration succeeded, so wanted to get those changes in
	people's hands.
	I have not tested the changes to make the Linux build use the new CollectCppUnitTests build process.
