This data set is my own Quiegolani Zapotec LinguaLinks language project. It has a dictionary with lots of entries, as well as several texts that are in one state or another of being analyzed. There are no feature structures in the data set, since LL knows zip about them. I will update this data set, as the FW model develops.

To load the data run: "nant ZPITest-nodep" from the Bld folder.

This is current to version 76 of the NewLangProj.xml file.

Post-export and Unicode conversion tasks:

1. Add Moe's domain info where it says: <!-- PASTE MOE DOMAIN LIST DATA HERE. -->.
2. Add UserView data where it says: <!-- PASTE USERVIEW DATA HERE. -->
