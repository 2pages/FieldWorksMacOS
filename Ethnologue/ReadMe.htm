<H1>Ethnologue Database</H1>
<P>((Revised 2 September, 2008, by Steve Miller)</P>
<P>FieldWorks distributes a subset of Ethnologue data to the field.
The idea is to give new language projects the ability to look up a
language name and find the appropriate Ethnologue code. Using that
Ethnologue code, we find the ICU code that FieldWorks needs to
operate correctly. We use ICU for collating.
</P>
<P>Somewhere around 2006, the Ethnologue codes became an ISO
standard. ISO 639-3 codes should now be synonymous with Ethnologue
codes...to a point. SIL has more recent data than exists on the ISO
site.</P>
<P>ICU currently uses the ISO 639-1 code, if available. Otherwise it
uses the ISO 639-3 code.</P>
<H2>Data Sources</H2>
<P>Much of this is also documented in comments in CreateEthnlogue.bat
and NormalizeData.sql.</P>
<P>The table with ISO 639-3, -2 (both -2T and -2B), and -1 codes is
at: <A HREF="http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/iso-639-3_20080804.tab">http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/iso-639-3_20080804.tab</A>.
Be sure to remove the first row from the file, which has column
headers. The file LanguageCodes.tab can be obtained from
<A HREF="http://www.ethnologue.com/codes/LanguageCodes.tab">http://www.ethnologue.com/codes/LanguageCodes.tab</A>.
The big difference between the two is that the latter has the country
where the language is most used. (We get country from
LanguageIndex.tab, though.) The former has the ISO 639-1 and -2
codes. The particular iso-639-3_20080804.tab we are using came from
Roger Hanggi.</P>
<P>Data for the Ethnologue can also be found at:
<A HREF="https://www.grove.insitehome.org/enterprise/sMicrosoft/iHub/guest/select_Language_Code">https://www.grove.insitehome.org/enterprise/sMicrosoft/iHub/guest/select_Language_Code</A>.
Roger Hanggi said the Ethnologue data on insite (IHUB) and the ISO
639 site should be the same. &ldquo;To clarify the relationship, Joan
Spanne as ISO-639-3 registrar maintains an ISO database that feeds
the download tables at the sil.org/iso639-3 site. We query that
database after changes are made to update the IHub list. So if there
ever is a short-term difference, it means we are behind in updating
IHub. &rdquo;</P>
<P>Laurie Nelson has a mapping of Ethnologue 14 to 15. She is working
on a map of Ethnologue 15 to 16. We currently have not used these
mappings for migrating.</P>
<P>The codes that ICU uses can be found in
C:\fw\DistFiles\Icu36\data\locales\en.txt, under the section
&ldquo;Languages&rdquo;. Most of the ICU codes are already the same,
but a fair number of them are not. Updates are done in
NormalizDate.sql to try to get the codes as close as possible. See
the lists of language names for which ICU codes were changed there.</P>
<P>The country codes are now at:
<A HREF="http://www.iso.org/iso/list-en1-semic-2.txt">http://www.iso.org/iso/list-en1-semic-2.txt</A>.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Two views are written, mostly to show
relations between the tables.</P>
<H2>Programs and Code</H2>
<P>The code saw significant revision from the previous version. Most
of this was due to the fact that the Ethnologue codes were accepted
as the ISO standard. Other function and procedures were never used by
the application, and were eliminated as YAGNI (&ldquo;you aren't
gonna need it&rdquo;).</P>
<P>One more bit of refactoring that should be considered next time is
the elimination of the identity column, at least in the Ethnologue
table. I would have done it this time, but I have already spent more
time than I wanted.</P>
<P>The main program is the batch file CreateEthnologue.bat. It
executes three .sql scripts, as well as a number of commands to
import data from tab delimited lists. Follow the batch file, and you
should be able to piece together most of what's going on. The three
SQL scripts are used to create the Ethnologue database are:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CreateDb.sql
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">NormalizeData.sql
	</P>
	<LI><P>ProcsFuncs.sql
	</P>
</OL>
<P>To build the database manually, use the file CreateEthnologue.bat.
It needs to be called with a single argument which is the location of
the Ethnologue directory (e.g., CreateEthnologue <A HREF="/c:/fw/Ethnologue">c:\fw\Ethnologue</A>).&nbsp;</P>
<P>NAnt runs this batch file if the database file is missing, or if
the database file Ethnologue.mdb has a date that is older than the
CreateEthnologue.bat file. Otherwise the Ethnologue database will
remain unchanged.</P>
<H2>Unit Tests</H2>
<P>The unit tests are in  Test\ut_ProcsFuncs.sql. Thes currently use
the tsqlunit testing framework.
